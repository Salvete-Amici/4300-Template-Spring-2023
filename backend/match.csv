58224,These are so good!! My family devoured them - it's so easy to make! i agree with ReeLani - it is very addicting to sample while it's cooking! i did add 4 cloves of garlic (we love garlic)and some minced onion (on the side) - will definitely make again and again! Thanks!
58224,"This was easy, delicious, and extremely versatile. I can see endless options with this baby.This time I served it on toasted Kaiser buns. Cayenne amount was just right for me, but I added 2 cloves of garlic but will add more next time (personnal preference). I had a medium cheddar, so that's what i used."
58224,"Yummm!!  I sampled this a few times as it was cooking and didn't think I would find it too fascinating, but once it was done I found myself quickly addicted!  I had mine plain on a plate with no starches, but a good crusty roll would have been an excellent accompaniment.  I'll be sharing some of this with my mom, and I know she'll share my opinion.  "
58224,"This was great.  I halved the recipe for just my bf and I, he loved it.  Don't all guys love beef?  I added a little more cayenne and half a yellow onion while browning the meat.  We ate this on low-fat wheat buns. Lots of leftovers! Delicious!  Definitely a summer must have!"
58224,"This was a cheesy twist on sloppy joes.  It made a very easy week-night dinner served on toasted buns with oven fries, cottage cheese, and sliced tomatoes.  I added diced onion as I browned the beef and used Lawry's seasoned salt instead of regular.  My hubby ate some of the leftovers with tortilla chips as a hot-hamburger dip.  "
58224,"Boy was this a treat!  Bye bye, sloppy joes - hello ""immoral"" loose meat!! My dh and son and I all loved this stuff.  Okay, I have to confess I added some chopped onion while browning the meat.  I can't help it, I just love onion.  If anyone is leery of trying this because of the beer - don't be! You will be surprised at the wonderful flavor it imparts as it cooks away.  I served this open-faced on toasted hamburger buns.  Great easy meal for busy weeknights or anytime.  "
58224,"A confession, I liked this much better luke warm....on a toasted bun it reminded me of a meatloaf sandwich. I followed directions to the ""T"" and it took approximately 1 hour to cook down. It made a great weeknight dinner with chips and dip and slaw. And I liked it because it made enough to freeze half for future use."
58224,"My daughters boyfriend is from Iowa and loves ""Maidrites"" but this wasn't exactly what I remebered.  I combined then a couple of recipe's as when I first tasted the hamburg mixture I knew it wasn't right.  Omitted this recipe sugar and added 3/4 cup of brown sugar, 1 can of sloppy joe mix, dark beer,and used veveeta instead of american cheese.  Turned out great, a little on the sweeter side."
58224,These were a little close to what I grew up eating Maid-Rites in my hometown in Ohio.  The Maid-Rite restaurant opened in the 1940's.  Rumor has it that the ground beef is steamed in beer.  What I don't like about these is the garlic in them.
58224,"I used to drive 2 hours to Ohio to get these loose meat hamburgers called Maid Rite. Now I can make them any time I want. These are GREAT! The only change I made was adding some fine diced onion to my hamburger as it fried and cut the recipe by 1/3 since I only had 1 pound of hamburger. This made enough for 5 hamburgers for us. Thanks for posting this one, I will be making often. Served with chips and cold beer. Yum, yum, yum."
58224,This recipe ROCKS!!!  Yum-oh!  The kids loved it as is...the big kids loved it with a splash of peri-peri hot sauce over the top.  Cheers ThatBobbieGirl!  Thanks for sharing
58224,"Being from Alabama, I had never heard of these. They truly are awesome. So easy! I can't say if they are true to the midwest way of making, but they are a new favorite here in Birmingham. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!!"
58224,"I liked this so much I registered just so I could comment on it. I wanted to have cheeseburgers tonight, but I didn't want to have the mess that goes with them. This recipe was perfect, and the seasonings are just right. Would give it 10 stars if I could!"
58224,"My fiance, who is not hard to please, said, ""um, its not that great."" We were both kind of grossed out by the creamy liquid that accompanied it, but we ate it anyway. I was very thankful that I sauteed some onion separately and then added it to the mixture. And thank God I had some pickles on hand, because at my first bite, it was very obvious that they were missing from the equation."
58224,"Very Very good!  I had to add onions of course, The only other changes I made was a little smoked paprika for color and smokey flavor, and pre-shredded cheese because I'm a caterer, and like to take any short cuts possible.  But the changes were good, and I think the recipe would be excellent without them also.  I've moved it to my ""Stuff we like"" cookbook.  Thanks TBG for another keeper!"
58224,"Sorry...We just did not care for this. I did add a onion and hot pepper flakes. But has my Dh said this taste as weird as it looks.  But he ate it LOL.But that is the fun of cooking, trying something new.I did cut the recipe to 6serv.  And some times that does not work.  thanks,Bobbie Girl"
58224,"This was great!  I didn't have venison burger, but I had stew meat, so I used that.  I added an onion as well and saut√©ed it with the garlic before browning the meat.  I used a Guinness extra stout and it turned out wonderful!  Kind of like a Cottage Pie since I served it over roughly mashed yukon gold potatoes.  When most of the liquid had evaporated I added a tablespoon of flour and made a gravy.  I added sharp cheddar, but it didn't make much of a difference for my dish.  It was mainly the Guinness that gave it flavor.  I love the flexibility of this recipe!  I'll definitely be making it again!"
58224,"OUt of this world!!! So much better than the typical burger. We had friends over for dinner last night. Three decided on a grilled burger and two of us chose the ""Immoral Burger"". Guess what we fed to the cats? Yep.. the grilled burgers. Thanks for sharing a super recipe. They are great served with dill pickle and chopped onion and most certainly on a nice soft white bun."
58224,"This was really a very nice change from plain burgers! I had only 3/4 lb of beef to use up, and I was able to cut the recipe down perfectly.  I used brown mustard (all I had) and just a small squirt of ketchup (for my hubby's taste), but everything else was to the letter.  I steamed a couple hoagie buns on top of the meat and topped our big sandwiches with American cheese and dill pickles.  It was WONDERFUL!  Thanks for a great recipe!"
58224,"Delicious sandwich. Salt and pepper amounts used--2 t. salt, 1 t. coarse black pepper. Served on lightly toasted buns spread w/ yellow mustard and added dill pickles slices on top. I love the cheese slices melted into the ground beef. A quick and easy supper for us. Thanks for sharing."
58224,Wonderful tangy sloppy sandwich.
97052,This was very good.  I only had 19 very large ears but it still used up the entire amount of 1/2 and 1/2 although I did halve the butter.   I had to keep shooing my dh away while it was cooling down as he kept trying to snitch some.  Thanks for a different way to put up corn.
97052,"So delicious and so easy.  But it doesn't make a whole  lot, especially when one keeps sampling as it cooks.  I made a half-recipe with 24 ears of corn, dividing the butter and half-and-half.  Then had to go buy more corn to make more, kind of pricy at $4 per dozen!  But it will be so good at Thanksgiving."
97052,"I was getting ready to submit this recipe, but thought I would check first to see if it was already listed.  Here it is....and this is such a wonderful recipe for corn lovers.  The first 2 weeks we moved to Wisconsin, we made this night and day....it was so worth it!!"
97052,"Just had another bag of our corn from last year made with this recipe. It's so sweet, my DH says it's almost like dessert. I've found the best way to prepared is to keep it frozen until use, then thaw and cook in the microwave until hot. Otherwise, if you let it thaw, you'll lose a lot of the butter because it sticks to the bag/container. This is one of our favorite vegetables and is wonderful!"
97052,There's got to be away to give you more than 5 stars for this!   We just had a bag that I made a couple weeks ago and DH was thrilled!     Thanks for a great way to preserve the taste of summer.
97052,"Judikins,  This was delicious.  I picked up several cases of corn at the Olathe Sweet ""Sweet"" Corn Festival yesterday.  I wanted to freeze some for those cold winter months! Imagine my surprise to find a fellow ""corn freezer"" using the Olathe sweet corn as the basis of her freezer corn recipe.  Thanks so much.  I'm sure we'll enjoy it even more in January."
97052,This recipe is absolutely delicious!  I love the helpful hint for using an angel food cake pan and an electric knife to prepare the corn.  I will use this recipe for years to come.Lori W.
97052,"My FIL gave me a bunch of corn (not very sweet) so I wanted to make some of this freezer corn to use in corn chowder recipes this winter.  This method is terrific.  I was able to cut a cob every 30 seconds with the electric knife.  Very neat & clean.  My BIL and FIL who freeze a lot of corn each year, will be switching to this technique."
97052,"Wow!  I just pulled out my first batch of this corn, and WOW!  I just made half because I was afraid I wouldn&#039;t like it as well as everyone else has rated it, but I was wrong.  I can see now that I&#039;m going to have to go buy more corn.  I still cooked the corn an hour even though I halved the recipe.  It turned out perfectly cooked. The corn comes out firm with flavor bursting in your mouth after an hour at 325. I did add a bit of sugar to the mix when cooking, but always add it to my corn.  You just add it to taste, but I probably used close to 1/4 cup when it was all said and done.  I used a regular knife and just turned a cup upside down in the roaster to replicate the Angel Food Cake technique.  Worked great and kept the mess to a minimum.  Now if someone could just tell me how to get the silks off the corn a little better.  Thanks so much Judikins for sharing this great recipe."
97052,"This is wonderful.  My sister gave me this recipe years ago, and I lost it.  Thanks for posting recipe!"
93958,"I used only all-purpose flour for this recipe and, because sorghum is unavailable, here, subbed molasses instead, which worked out fine, although it may have made the muffin a bit darker in appearance.  The muffins were very nicely-flavoured - the spice /cocoa/citrus combo coming out well.  Good rise, and tender crumb.  Excellent accompaniment to a cup of hot coffee!"
49262,This was the first time I've made hollandaise sauce and it turned out great! I put a heatproof glass bowl over a pot of simmering/boiling water since I do not have a double boiler per-say. Everyone loved it! I will definatly make this again.
49262,Oh ... My ... God.   Where did you get my Grandmother's recipe?!?    LOL.  Thank god for those who still know what a double boiler is for!! Can I give this one 10 stars?  Please?!?
49262,"I used this recipe in a pinch when I realized I didn't have enough hollandaise. It was good, but I thought it fell short of the real deal. I mixed it with the other hollaindaise I had and it worked out well. Thank you for helping save dinner!LOL"
49262,"Forget it.  Go with the recipe in Joy of Cooking.  Same ingredients, a bit more work but well worth it.  I found this recipe very disappointing."
208179,I have made a recipe just like this for years. The cream cheese route sounds excellent. This recipe is also very good on a chocolate cake. My mother makes it with a white milk cake that she has cut in half a spread with raspberry jam. She then uses this icing and sprinkles it with mini chocolate chips.
60219,"We liked the sauce and thought it was very clever of the chef. However, we did not really care for it on pasta, even though we are pasta lovers. I'll definitely make the sauce again but I'll use it on nachos or something similar."
74805,"I don't know why this works, but it sure does!  I used it in a trifle and it held up beautifully.  Great substitute for cool whip.  Thanks, Toby, you've done it again!"
74805,"Topped Key Lime Pie #41575 with this whipped cream, then used it the next night as a fruit dip for a party.  It was well received everywhere.  Note:  I used sugar-free vanilla instant pudding mix, and it was fine, but I think the vanilla flavor would've been even better if it *wasn't* sugar-free. Next time.  And there will be a next time!"
74805,"Easy to make, delicious and holds up well!"
74805,I've made this several times now and it always turns out great. I used it on a banana cream pie for Thanksgiving and it help up even after being left out of the fridge for about 7 hours. Thanks for a great recipe!
74805,It works! Needs some extra flavor though. Thanks!
74805,"This is wonderful!  I used 2 tablespoons of powdered sugar, and it was just the right amount of sweetness for us.  This holds up beautifully.  Thanks for posting!"
74805,Delicious! I ate almost all of it myself with some jumbo strawberries and bananas!! It was wonderful! Thank you for a great recipe!
74805,Super easy and good! I used 3 TBL of powdered sugar (I like it sweet) and I didn't have vanilla instant pudding but I had cheesecake instant pudding so I used that. Wonderful! Thank you for an easy and quick recipe!
74805,"This worked quite well, as I prefer to prepare everything I can ahead of time when I am having guests and never enjoy having to whip cream at the last minute to serve with dessert. I don't think you could pass it off as simple freshly-whipped cream, but it made a very nice topping. I used French vanilla pudding mix and didn't add any more sugar than called for, since I was serving it with a very rich, sweet dessert (Recipe #199902) and thought the cream was plenty sweet anyway. (There seems to be a lot of recipes out there that call for Cool Whip as an ingredient, as well as a lot of people who don't like to use it. I think (as long as you aren't also opposed to using pudding mix) that this would be a great alternative to Cool Whip in those recipes.) Thanks for posting!"
74805,"This is an excellent recipe!  I made it to add to a New York Cheesecake with strawberries, and the consistency is amazing!  It's thick, rich, and delicious!  Thank you!"
74805,"I messed up, so will leave comments only. For some reason I only bought a half pint of whipped cream, thinking it was a pint, and I didn't realize my mistake until I was mixing everything and it became super thick! So I added some 2% milk and continued to whip until it was a nice consistency. So, it wasn't exactly whipped cream, BUT it was yummy and light. So if anyone wants a lower calorie version of this, substitute milk for some of it and it will work. I served with Recipe #79394 and some strawberries. Yum!"
74805,i love this recipe its easy great and it keeps it shape so if u forget u made it itll be good for some time
74805,Perfect!!!
74805,Tried this and it worked perfectly.  Will use this regularly.  Thanks.
74805,This recipe is great!  I used it as a frosting for my three-year old son's birthday cake.  It held up wonderfully and tasted great.  My father has requested that I make it again this week for his birthday cake.
74805,Excellent and super easy.  It was good in the fridge for days.  My husband wants me to make this all the time for him now.  Thanks!
74805,"Perfect! I had some chocolate covered strawberries, a pint of whipping cream, and some French Vanilla instant pudding mix so I decided to whip this up. Divine! The texture and taste is so light and airy, but incredibly savory! I'd love to make this again and again- I may never buy another canister of whipped cream.   :D"
74805,Cool!  What a great trick---It's delicious and convenient. Made my whipped cream 24 hours before my dinner party and it was delicious. I used 2 tsp powdered sugar.
74805,"This was great!  I've never had homemade whipped cream before, and this was just divine!"
74805,Great recipe! I used this on Banana Cream Pie
74805,"Absolutely delicious and delivers on its ""never weep"" promise. I've made it regular and also tried it sweetened with a few drops of stevia instead of sugar to keep it a bit more diet friendly.Never going back to Cool Whip! So delicious and fast."
74805,Very easy process and quite tasty!  Made for Pavlova recipe #230228 that my son needs to take in for international day at school tomorrow.  We'll see how this whip cream holds up :o)  Should be consumed approx. 1 hour after he gets in without any refridgeration except for the chilly fall air.  Will post results.
74805,OH MY!  5 stars IS NOT ENOUGH!  This whipped cream is beyond delicious!  Perfect flavor and the best of all --- SO EASY!  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!  Did I mention I could eat it with a spoon!  NEVER AGAIN will I use COOLWHIP!  Thank you for a WONDERFUL recipe!
74805,"Great recipe! Never thought of using vanilla pudding. Made this to top recipe #57679 and it was perfect. Didn't add any additional sugar as others have because the pie was sweet to begin with. Made in the KA gradually increasing the speed to 8, then it took 3 mins from there. Thanks Toby for a recipe I will use for years to come!"
74805,"I've been making this for so long I never realized I never reviewed. This is great stuff! I made it sugar-free for my mom who was dying for whipped cream. I was able to make the powdered sugar with splenda, powdered milk and cornstarch processed together. Thanks for this great recipe which I am already using over and over!"
74805,"This was my 1st (and 2nd) attempts at making homemade whipped cream for Thanksgiving & it was yummy.  Like others, I too used a little more powdered sugar.  My only piece of advice to others making whipped topping for the 1st time is to be careful not to OVERWHIP.  I whipped my 1st batch too long & it ended up the consistency of whipped butter.  (My error). However, the 2nd batch was perfect.  Thanks for posting Toby."
74805,This is a great recipe! I used it over the holidays and the it never once let me down. I've used the leftovers in my coffee!  A great treat.
74805,Fantastic!  I followed the recipe but used about 1/3 cup of powdered sugar and it whipped up fantastically.  I also followed Pixie's recipe advice in that I chilled the bowl and the beaters in the freezer beforehand.  I got it whipped up in about 3-4 minutes using an electric hand beater.  I don't know why anyone buys the artificial whip.
74805,Delicious whipped cream! I used this lovely whipped cream on a cake. Sadly I can't really review how well it held up because we gobbled that cake up quick! Thanks :)
74805,"Great recipe- I would definitely add more sugar.   I used white chocolate pudding mix instead, and the hint of white chocolate was perfect!!"
74805,"As a whipped cream finatic, I love, love, love this recipe!  I can always have it on hand in the fridge and it tastes great!"
74805,made 1/2 batch using whit chocolate pudding...YUM-O!!!!
74805,"This is a wonderful, easy recipe. I've used it many times and it never fails. I use a lot more powered sugar than Toby uses. It freezes extremely well. I 've tried it on several recipes.   I made lemon coconut tartlets (picture) topped with this cream. I made a large batch, put them in the freezer and took them out in time for the party. They came out like I put them in.  Thanks Toby!"
74805,Yummy.  Easy.  Enough Said.
74805,"Used this is Recipe #16028 and it worked wonderfully well. Absolutely held up for a couple of days. This is my new ""go-to"" recipe. I've made the stabilized whipped cream with gelatin that I haven't been able to get right, but you just can't mess this one up. Thanks for sharing!"
74805,"Excellent!!! Easy peasy, and delicious! Family said no more Cool Whip or Reddi Whip in this home. We liked two tsp. of powdered sugar, might go for three tsp. next time just cause.  Thanks, Toby!"
74805,"THIS HAS GOT TO BE HANDS DOWN THE BEST WHIPPED CREAM ME AND MY ENTIRE FAMILY HAVE EVER EATEN AND WILL EVER HAVE IN OUR LIVES!! ok, I know that was a bit dramatic, but you don't understand how spectacular this was. I made a gingerbread waffle batter then blessed the top with some melted Nutela, topped it with a scoop of Ben & Jerry's chunky monkey ice cream then finished it off with this whipped cream of love and let some powdered sugar snow atop it all and this was the best desert in the planet! I added an extra tablespoon of the dry pudding and I mixed it with an electric mixer on high and it was the fluffiest little cloud of love.."
74805,Excellent taste and it keeps forever in the fridge.This is the perfect whipped cream
74805,"Oh so good!!!  Even better, faster and easier to make than expected!  I used powdered stevia instead of sugar.  Licked the bowl clean :)"
74805,The taste of the whipped cream was delicious.  I used it to frost a guava cake for my husband's birthday.
74805,perfect perfect perfect!
74805,I grew up in a old fashioned Italian family where all things buttercream  were disliked.  This whipped cream would make my grandma proud! I iced a white almond sour cream cake with this...pure heaven! Thank you so much for this fabulous recipe!
74805,This is a great recipe for whipped cream and is so easy to make :)  I used french vanilla pudding mix for a little extra vanilla taste. Thanks for sharing this Toby. Five stars and two thumbs up for this one :)
74805,This turned out fabulous! It's been in my fridge for a few days and still tastes and looks wonderful. I served it with Amanda's Cheese Pound Cake and strawberries. DELICIOUS!
74805,"I made this to dip strawberries in and it tastes amazing, I will use this again!"
74805,Two soul mates lost and separated by a few recipes...recipe #398053 and recipe #74805.
74805,"Toby,  I have made this several times and loved it.. How I never reviewed it is a mystery..I did use a little more sugar.  The taste and texture could not be better, and yes it did keep for a week .. Thanks for sharing."
74805,"This is absolutely amazing!  I love the taste of real whipped cream and not the fake kind used by bakeries of grocery stores.  However, whipped cream is normally impossible to decorate with but not with this recipe.  I was able to decorate my daughter's baptism cake with it and even used the air brush technique and it took well.  The cake sat on display at an indoor reception in August without deflating, weeping, melting, whatever.  The clouds stayed puffy, the colors stayed put, and it tasted great still.  Whipped cream always tastes better chilled so I actually made a second sheet cake to keep in the fridge and served that while I returned the decorated one back in the fridge.  We actually ended up not having to serve that one but we sure did enjoy it later that day an it still looked beautiful after all that displaying and transferring.  This will be my go-to whipped cream topping from now on!!!  I did double the sugar because I wanted it hjust a tad sweeter and that ended up just right for me.  THANKS for posting!"
74805,"This was great, and so easy!"
74805,Fabulous. Thanks for Sharing
74805,"Wish I could give this more stars. I hate deflated whipped cream, but don't often have the time to add it at the last minute. So easy too."
74805,"Wow! This whipped cream lasted on my cream pie, unrefrigerated, at a potluck for hours! It was a hit! Super professional looking, too!"
74805,"This whipped cream recipe is most excellent!<br/><br/>I get requests for the recipe all the time, especially when I bring it into work!"
74805,"This really delivers on its promise! My pie was in the fridge for almost two weeks with no weeping! I would add more sugar to mine the next time, but other than that this is an awesome recipe! Thanks for posting!"
74805,OH MY!!!!!!!...Just bought 4 pounds of fresh strawberries....I made this and said to myself...Where has this recipe been all of my life....AMAZING....Thank you so much Toby for a winner here.....<br/>The paring of this with fruit.... cake... oh even fingers...... has me excited for sure..............Thank You!.......... Thank You............
74805,"This whipped cream is unbelievable!!!!  I've never made my own before so was a little nervous about it but it turned out great!  Used it to frost Karen's recipe #23480.  The only change I would make next time would be to add more sugar.  Since there was a little bit left, I stored it in the refrigerator and tasted it a week later and it was just as nice then as it was when first made.  Wow!  I'm so impressed with this and no longer scared of whipped cream.  Thanks so much, Toby Jermain!"
74805,"I think the pudding really adds to it.  This was my first time making whipped cream, and I couldn't be any happier with the outcome.   This will be my go to recipe from now on."
74805,"I used this for my Banana Cream Pie, and this worked beautifully!  I will be using this from now on.  Thank you for sharing, Toby! :-)"
74805,"Wonderful!  All I had was sugar free vanilla pudding, I used a heaping teaspoonful to a 1/2 pint of heavy cream. Perfection. I can't wait to try it in cream puffs."
74805,Perfect!!
74805,"Fabulous!! I used rum flavour instead of the vanilla, it turned out GREAT.  I seved the whipped cream with #71892 Gingerbread Cake.  I will be using this recipe again!!"
74805,"Wonderful. We didn't have vanilla instant pudding, but we did have a candy cane flavored instant pudding. We used that, and it came out FANTASTIC! A nice peppermint flavor on top of our chocolate pudding. YUM! Thank you so much for this recipe, I'm going to be experimenting with all sorts of flavors now!"
74805,"absolutely amazing recipe!! easy, took all of 5 min as stated..faster then thawing out the coolwhip!! made home made angel food cake (charlotte j) and mixed some of the whipped cream with blueberries and strawberries for the middle of cake (split in 2) then frosted the cake with remainder, excellent thanks for converting this coolwhip gal!!"
74805,"I tried it and this was great!! I used a limited edition Pumpkin Spice jello.  Delish! I too doubled the powdered sugar.  I used my ""cool whip"" as a filling for mousse.  Very good.  Thanks for sharing!!"
74805,"This is amazing.  It has been in my refrigerator for 2 days and absolutely no change in consistency or taste.  This is exactly what I had been searching for.  I, too, added just a tad more sugar.  Definitely try this recipe, I will never make whipped cream again the regular old-fashioned way.  I have it sitting on my counter on a cupcake right now to see how it holds up for display at a shower.  Thank you for sharing."
74805,"Love this! This is amazing! I use it when I make cream puffs and it turns out beautifully. I use sugar free pudding and it holds its shape for at least 3 days as a filling in the fridge...it could be longer but it doesn't last long enough to find out! I double the recipe, and it's enough to fill 8-9 LARGE cream puffs. I do add 4 tsps of powdered sugar to the doubled recipe for a little sweeter taste and more stability.  Make sure that you use pure heavy cream, I have found it doesn't whip up as nice if there is other things added to the cream."
74805,This was fabulous!  I used it with some almond pound cake and strawberries!  My husband (who is usually the person that makes the whipped cream) LOVED it.  Thanks for making me look goooood!
74805,"This was very easy to make and tasted wonderful!  I could taste the vanilla pudding flavor slightly too, which made me wonder if it would be good with strawberry or  chocolate pudding mix to give it a slightly different flavor (we may try that next time :).  Thanks, Toby - we loved this recipe!!<br/>update: we use 2 T powder sugar and 3/4 t vanilla, and that is the perfect sweetness for us."
74805,"What can I say, this recipe is awesome.  I put this on a pie for Thanksgiving, and four days later the whipped cream still hadn't weeped.  I'll never make whipped cream without the added vanilla pudding ever mix again!"
74805,"Fabulous recipe!  I have made it so often that I don't need to look at it anymore!  I just whip up some cream, add a spoonful or two of pudding mix and powdered sugar to taste.  It is really great on anything you can think of.  Lately we like it on shortcakes.  It was also wonderful in a Victoria Sponge.  Because it doesn't break down, I can make the cakes the night before, and they are still terrific the next day- even a bit better.  Thanks for sharing!"
74805,I made this to directions and it was great. My sister who does not like whipped Cream even liked it for it was not to sweet at all. I used it on our Pumpkin Pie and then in some Hot Chocolate so that I could use it up. It lasted almost a week before it was all gone.
74805,I am so glad i found this recipe!!! I love making cupcakes but i find butter cream to sweet. this was delicious and perfect for piping. Will be using this again and again!!!! Thank you
74805,"works like a charm!  I used 1/2 of the pudding mix called for, and it still stayed stiff and fluffy for days.  Perfect for topping banana cream or coconut cream pies.  Thank you!"
74805,"Yum - the only instant I had was coconut cream so I used that.  You can&#039;t really taste the coconut - just get a flake of coconut once in awhile.  I did add a little extra sugar to make it sweeter.  I don&#039;t know about it lasting a week - mine will be gone  long before the week is up, but what an awesome idea.  Also want to try to freeze some to keep on hand, but will have to do that next time."
74805,Made this for my Pumpkin Spice Lattes and it was awesome!!  Used and kept for almost 2 weeks with no weep and taste was still perfect!!!
74805,"I usually cut this recipe in half and increase the powdered sugar to 2-3 Tbs for sweet whipped cream.  It works wonderfully and tastes amazing.  Even my better half, who isn&#039;t a fan of whipped cream, was eating this by the spoonfull.  I tend to keep the leftover whipped cream in a piping bag, with the tip on it, standing in a glass in the fridge and it definately kept for at least a week (before I just threw in the towel and finished it off myself)."
74805,"I can&#039;t thank you enough for this recipe. I was making my usual tres leches cake, but trying out a new pan, and it was an unmitigated disaster. I had planned on using your recipe to start out with but didnt know that i would need it to save my cake. I did add extra sugar but left everything else the same. It was a breeze to make and really fixed the boo-boos on the cake because it was able to cover everything so well. five stars and then some. Peggy Lynn"
74805,"Never rated this, but have used it over and over and over!  Great! Great! Great!  Easy to make, tasty, and versatile.  I have used vanilla and banana pudding."
74805,Love this recipe!!  So yummy!!!
74805,"I've used this for years, but never reviewed it. I just made an account specifically to rate this! I've used it with so many flavors of pudding! I do increase the powdered sugar to 2T, but the rest is the same. I've kept this in the fridge for a long time. I've even frozen cupcakes with this frosting, and they thawed perfectly and tasted just the same. Wonderful!!!"
124286,Just as easy and good as I remember.  It was too thick so I added a few tablespoons of water to get to the right consistency.  Made for My 3 Chegs.
107699,my mother used to call this gypsy toast 
53402,"This definitely is a great lasagne, but seriously, DON'T use as much salt as the recipe calls for.  1/2 tsp. for the whole batch should be enough."
53402,"Yum, Yum, Yum!  This was terrific. We added extra garlic, used turkey sausage and ground beef, total of 1 tsp salt, added extra sauce (1 jar of Organic spaghetti sauce) This also freezes well. Great recipe-Thanks"
53402,"My husband is a very picky eater, but he loves this lasagna! I have used both ground turkey and ground beef and it's great either way. It's fairly simple to make and chances are, you won't have to worry about finding a place for leftovers. It definitely is ""killer."""
53402,"This lasagne is really ""Killer""! My son told me this was the best lasagne he has ever eaten! What a compliment... especially from him :-) The only change I made was the addition of pepperoni slices. The dish turned out excellent! It WILL be made again in this household!"
53402,"I used ground beef and pepperoni and it was great!  Make sure you let the lasagna set for about 15 minutes after taking out of the oven, so it comes out in pieces rather than sliding out onto your plate in a glob!"
22526,I made these a while back for a fellowship meeting at church and forgot to rate them. They were really good and easy. Everybody loved them. Thanks for sharing.
22526,I printed this recipe several weeks ago and had not tried it. This morning I got up to the smell of baking to find hubby had found the recipe and made it as a surprise.I worked till midnight so i never even saw it. What a great surprise and boy is it delicious!!!! 
22526,Fantastic!  And couldn't be easier.  A big hit at my house.
22526,"So EASY!  Big hit with the kids!  I'm sure they ate more then their fair share!  I have found this recipe in several different sites with the only difference being the amount of cinnamon used.  I see amounts ranging from 2 teaspoons to 2 tablespoons (unless it's a typo!)  I used a little over one tablespoon judging by just what looked like ""enough"".  It was very good that way!  Only problem I found was ""cutting"" it into slices so we just pulled it apart and ate it!  Very Yummy!  A great thing to do on the Eve of something like Christmas when you don't want to get up and fix breakfast the next morning.  Good for making while on a vacation with a kitchen as not much is needed for a great home cooked breakfast treat!"
22526,"Killian, I should have mentioned in the recipe that you just pull it apart.  Glad you enjoyed it so much."
22526,VERY GOOD! We really enjoyed it.Thanks
22526,"I LOVE waking up and just popping this in the oven!  And it tastes great, too. (can't go wrong with cinnamon)  Thankyou for our new holiday breakfast."
22526,Thank you for such an easy delicious breakfast for company.  Everyone thinks I spend a lot of time preparing this!  I make this everytime we have overnight guests.  My four year old loves to wake up and smell them baking.  I use the full amount of cinnamon and occasionally add some pecans or walnuts.  One nice thing about this recipe is that it is easy to keep all the ingredients on hand.  
22526,"I love that these can be put together at night and just popped in the oven in the morning. I made these with frozen egg twist rolls (Kineret Chall-ettes) which made these even richer.  However, they must be larger than the frozen rolls referred to in the original recipe.  I put 16 rolls in a bundt pan, and they rose considerably higher than the pan.  They were still delicious, but not so pretty.  Next time, I'll make them with just 8 rolls and they should be gorgeous as well as tasty."
22526,"Awesome Recipe! My friend gave this recipe to me as well and it is the easiest thing to make! I make my homemade buns recipe#58660 and when I reach the step of forming them into buns, I roll these into golf ball size rolls and freeze them in a single layer on a cookie sheet. When they are fully frozen I place them into a container and I'm all set to whip up a fancy morning breakfast! I really enjoyed the smell of these as they baked in the oven and my family, including our exchange student who doesn't like a lot of bread, gobbled up this when I made it for breakfst last week. My husband even put in a request to have it every Sunday! Thanks for posting!"
22526,"This was the most simple, delicious recipe I think i've ever found. I use to make homemade cinnamon rolls and my family would beg for them, I cooked this recipe when they were all over and the taste was so much the same i'll never go to all the trouble of making the other recipe again! It's land of nod for me from now on!! Thank you for your recipe"
22526,"These were great.  I added more brown sugar, cinnamon and pudding.  I also used walnuts instead of raisins.  I will be making these often.  I would also suggest placing the bundt pan on a pizza pan or aluminum foil to catch any overflow."
22526,"Yum!  I love make ahead recipes - followed this one exactly with great results.  Easy, and so delicious hot out of the oven.  I left the leftovers out after breakfast and everyone broke off a piece every time they walked by the kitchen counter!"
22526,"Great recipe!  I'm not reall gung-ho about cinnamon, so I just used 1/2 tbsp and they were great!  Also used pecans instead of raisins.  However, after only 20 minutes of cooking, mine were already burning on top.  Fortunately, I like mine a little well done."
22526,Absolutely delicious and SOOOOOOO easy!  Can't get any better than that!!!
22526,"This was as easy as advertised. It is better than most store bought cinnamin rolls, and a snap to make. The warm freshness makes it especially good. You can also add pecans to the mix. Certainly not lo cal or lo carb, but delicious."
22526,I can't believe how easy this was.  It was delicious!  My husband was a bit skeptical when he saw me making it but loved it while he was eating it!!!  I will definitely be making this again (perhaps tomorrow!) because it was so easy to put together and very YUMMY!!!
22526,"Yum, Yum, I made these  with diet vanilla pudding and brown diet sugar twin. My husband loved them even though they were made with the diet ingredients. Will make many more times. I also used my own roll dough."
22526,"Unfortunately this just wasn't a hit with us.  We found the buns too ""sickly sweet"" with altogether too much of the topping on them that we were all picking it off to eat it.  After it cools I found that the topping takes on a very sticky texture that is like taffy sticking to your teeth.  It was extremely easy to make however.  It was worth the try. "
22526,"Excellent!Prepared as directed. I did use pecan halves around one half of a cup and no raisins. I also mixed up a powdered sugar icing using one cup powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons milk and drizzled that over the top of the rolls once I had inverted them onto a plate. Just great, a hit!thnks, PeggyLynn"
22526,"Isn't this a wonderful recipe?  My version uses a 3 oz box of instant butterscotch pudding instead of vanilla pudding, and pecans but not raisins.  To avoid bad language, I prepare it in an angel food cake pan instead of a bundt pan.  Thanks for sharing, Bert."
22526,"Delicious! Made with sugar free pudding and it was wonderful. Enjoyed by everybody, especially me for it's ease - when you have guests and the house is busy it's a snap to do!"
22526,These were so good. I used sugar free pudding and made them in an angel food cake pan. They turned out perfect and so delicious. Thanks Bert
22526,"I first made this last year for Thanksgiving day breakfast.  Sorry that I forgot to review it then, because I have made it several times since!!  Not only did I forget to review it, I forgot to add it to my cookbook!  I'm feeling very blonde!  Had to ask for it in Request A Recipe! It is simply awesome, and oh so easy to do!  The kids just LOVE it!  It will become a holiday tradition in our house!"
22526,"Well, here it is Christmas morning.  I took your advice and put this incredible dessert together last night at midnight.  We all opened our presents today and then I popped it into the oven.  As they are cooking, obviously the house smelled like heaven on earth.  However, my two sons and husband were all tired and kept saying ""we're not hungry!"".  So, out comes the rolls, and I invert them onto a beautiful platter. I put on the saddes puppy dog face I could muster and said, ""I went through all this trouble (lol) to make this and no one will even try it - sniff, sniff.""  So, they said, ""okay, give us a piece.""  Guess what, in about 15 minutes the WHOLE ENTIRE PLATE WAS GONE! They went absolutely crazy.  They said it was the best thing they had ever tasted!  Thank you, thank you for giving me a wonderful recipe. You also gave me a wonderful, funny memory of my tired and cranky boys saying they weren't hungry and then eating the rolls like ravenous lions...lol!  Merry Christmas.tree luee dee"
22526,"I made these for Christmas morning and the whole pan was gone before lunch. I used a whole stick of butter, left off the raisins, and baked in a tube pan. They were very sweet and rich and enjoyed by all, even me, and I do not usually care for frozen bread dough. Besides being very tasty, these get 5 stars for being pathetically easy and so convenient on a very chaotic Christmas morning. Thanks so much, bert!"
22526,"Everyone wanted the recipe, making again for New Years Brunch!  TY"
22526,Mmmmmm. We loved this. I have made it twice this week. The first time we thought it had just a little bit too much cinnamon glaze on it so when I made it the second time I cut the glaze in half. I think that just a little more than half would be perfect. Thanks so much for a new and really easy breakfast idea! 
22526,"Extremely easy. The taste is sinful and my house smelled amazing. I couldn't find frozen rolls, so I bought 2 1 lb. loaves of frozen bread dough and cut them up. It worked beautifully. Yum! Yum!  (You can cut this recipe in half and bake for 20 min. in a loaf pan)."
22526,my children enjoyed this.The cinnamon sugar mixture was a little hard in places when I served it!! will make this again.
22526,This was so yummy! Easy to prepare. My whole family loved them. I followed the recipe exactly except I forgot to grease the pan and they were a little stuck. We just pulled them apart to eat. Thanks so much!
22526,"I have put these together the past two years on Christmas Eve to bake on Christmas morning. We like that morning to be a relaxing one, and I don't relish the idea of a lot of time spent in the kitchen. They are quite delicious, especially considering the minimal effort involved. Although I normally prefer making my own bread dough, I have no problem using frozen rolls in this situation and think it is fabulous to get up Christmas morning, preheat the oven, and shortly have the smell of cinnamon permeating our home while opening gifts. I do skip the raisins. Thanks for posting the recipe!"
22526,"These pull-apart cinnamon buns are mouth watering! Easy to make, fun to eat!  Tastes like you spent hours raising the dough, etc."
22526,"I have always done this buns for Xmas.  But like everything else I do, I change the recipe.  Since I never have vanilla pudding in the house, that is gone and I do cut the butter down to 1/4 cup.  I have, in the past, made up my own buns...froze them, then used them in this recipe.  I love  the fact that the recipe can be done the night before, so you are stress free in the morning!!"
22526,"I have three boys and none of them liked the rolls.  My husband and I thought they tasted pretty good, but not great.  They smelled great while baking and were beautiful when I inverted them on the plate, so I am a little disappointed.  Around the edges were especially dry with not much of the sauce on them and tasted like just plain dinner rolls.  I will probably not make this recipe again, but it was definitely worth the try.  Thanks, Bert.  I'm sorry I couldn't give it a better rating.  It just didn't work well for our family."
22526,"These were pretty good. They could have been better if the rolls were cut up into small pieces instead of left whole.  All in all, they were decent.  Probably won't make again though. "
22526,"This has become a favourite, on Christmas morning, when the grandparents come for breakfast. I use an angel food pan as well. I use a lipped cookie pan to catch the sugar/butter mixture, and to bake on so it doesn't drip in the oven as well. It grows in the oven too, so I use the lowest rack. Easy to make after wrapping the last present."
22526,"This recipe was great, my kids loved it. I added a bit too much of the vanilla pudding mix and it did make the brown sugar not melt into as much of a gooey syrup, but it didn't ruin it by any means. Stick to the exact measurements and you'll have better than bakery rolls."
22526,Very good.  I think I will cut my rolls in half next time so more of the bread is covered in goo. Great tasting topping!
22526,This recipe was great and so easy.  Thanks will be making this again.
22526,"So very easy and soooo delicious! Ok, they will not compare to let's say Cinnabon or Cinzano but for something quick and easy you can't do better.I followed the recipe to a T using 2 Tbsp of cinnamon and 1/2 cup of butter. I left out the raisins because no one here likes them.The only thing I did a little different is that I cut the buns in two so that more pieces had flavoring on them.Definite keeper for us! We will make these again soon."
22526,I've made this several times and it's always wonderful.
22526,"Very good and easiest cinn. bun recipe I ever made!  If you need them that day, just heat oven to 220 degrees for 10 mins, turn oven off and let the rolls rise in that warmed oven..they rise in about an hour. Then bake as directed.  Thanks for easy recipe!"
22526,"We loved this recipe. I have made it on the past two Christmas Eve's -- sooo easy and so good on Christmas morning when we are opening our gifts with our family. Thank you very much for posting it. I made pudding with the pudding mix I had left over from making this, I just used a little less milk than the recipe on the box of pudding called for."
22526,"This is amazing!  We had 6 overnight guests and I was fretting over what to make for breakfast... stumbled across this recipe and figured it was worth a shot. It was cheap, easy and something I wouldn't have to get up too early to do!  I used all 24 dinner rolls (Bridgefort is the only brand I could find), the whole box of instant pudding mix, 1 TB of cinnamon and then omitted the raisins (there were 4 kids)...   Let it rise overnight and panicked in the morning when the rolls were coming over the top of the bundt pan!  I pushed them back in and baked as stated...  25 min later, a BEAUTIFUL breakfast was ready for my still sleepy guests...  I served this with fresh bananas and apples... and EVERYONE cleaned their plates!  My DH even remarked that this rivaled his mothers family famous cinnamon rolls that she is requested to  make for every holiday and family function!    I LOVE this recipe and will be using it often!  Thank you so much!!"
22526,"I have made this several times when I have had overnight guests. It is so easy and tastes so good! I have modified the recipe using just 12 wholewheat frozen dough rolls, 1 tbsp cinnamon, half a stick of butter and 1/2 cup of walnuts or pecans instead of raisins. The rest is the same. I make it in a bundt pan and bake it for 20 mins."
22526,"Yummy!  I have always wanted to make cinnamon buns and yesterday I finally did it!  Had a group of gals over and everybody raved about them.  Just wish I had sprayed the pan more, but they were wonderful."
22526,"I had a craving for cinnamon rolls, but did not want to make the effort to roll out dough.  These satisfied my craving and they were wonderful.  I've already recommended them to many people."
22526,This is very good but I thought Pull Apart Monkey Bread Recipe #28980 is better.
22526,LOVE these!  I had lost the recipe and haven't made them for years and missed them on Christmas mornings!  So easy and so good.  I omit the raisins just for personal preference.  I am so thrilled to have it back in my life:)
22526,I also use a loaf of frozen bread dough sliced into 16 pieces instead of the rolls sometimes. Works just as well :)
333797,"I remember, vividly, eating gallons and gallons of this soup as a child growing up on the prairies of Minnesota. But, nothing was written down in those farm kitchens so I lost the original recipe. Thanks to Molly, I found her's posted on a forum and prayed it was the same: it is! Absolutely simple and budget conscious, it still delivers a whollup of a taste! I only used 2 quarts of water (we like it thick) and used marjoram instead of ginger (as grandma would have). Let it cook 2 hours, blended it, and then threw in smoked ham and let it simmer another hour. This soup with a spoon of yogurt on top and crusty rye rolls is perfect for any cold, brisk Winter day."
41756,These meatballs were delicious!  We had them for dinner last night and there were no leftovers.  I did mix 1 lb. of sausage in with my hamburg and the result was awesome!  My two very picky kids ate them up.
41756,These were a big hit for dinner last night.  The flavor is right on the mark and the preparation is fairly straight forward.  I did replace the sugar with Splenda and the result was quite acceptable.  I made a double batch hoping to put one in the freezer but they didn't make it that far!  I will definitely be making this one again and will have to triple it I guess!  Excellent recipe Boies!!
41756,"I gave this 5 stars because it was so good, I do have a couple of comments, and one is it is all sweet and no sour. I might try half the sugar next time and see what happens, and I also wonder if you could cook them for one hour with the same results.  One tip I have that I got from a Rachel Ray recipe is instead of frying, place meatballs on a slightly greased pan in a 425 degree oven for 10-12 minutes (I go for 15).  The meatballs come out surprisingly very nicely browned.  It's the only way I'll ever do meatballs again.  I'll tell you these were really good, I did freeze them and they were great reheated.   My husband and I ate the whole batch and will definitely make again.  Thanks for posting."
41756,"This was so good. I used Healthy Coice Tomato soup, ground turkey and splenda instead of the sugar and my entire family gobbled them up in no time. I will definately make this again."
41756,"Great recipe!   I did reduce the sugar to 3/4 C, and could reduce it further depending on what you like for flavor. A hit at the dinner table, will definately make again.Thanks for the great recipe!"
41756,Love this meatball recipe !! My 5 year old dislikes meat and this is one recipe he asks for at least once a week !
41756,"I cheated and used frozen meatballs and put everything (except used 3/4 cup sugar) in the crockpot on high for about three hours. It didn't reduce at all- I obviously wasn't thinking when I started this- so I added a cornstarch slurry a while before serving to thicken it up some. We all really liked the flavor of the sauce, despite the runniness of it, even though my husband thought an element of heat would be a nice touch. Just wanted to let others know that you wouldn't get great results in a crockpot. I definitely plan to make this again and follow the directions next time.  Revisiting my review to add the 5 stars!  Made as directed and it was still thinner than I anticipated but so good that I didn't really mind.  I will make this often I'm sure (especially if my boys have anything to say about it)."
41756,I've made this several times now and really like this recipe.  I bake the meatballs instead of frying but don't change anything else.  Thanks for posting.
428056,This soup was pretty good.  I think it needed something else...but wasn't sure what.  Made for ZWT #6 -2010
197013,Delicious and easy.
93249,"Very tasty bread!  I downsized the recipe for 1/2 of a loaf of French bread (split), and just added a portion of the packet of Hidden Valley to taste.  I also used unsalted butter, as the dressing mix can be very salty on its own.  I did not broil the bread, but instead heated on the top rack of my grill until toasty.  (I was grilling the remainder of the meal.)  As suggested, I served this as a side to bbq chicken with roasted corn on the cob and a tossed salad.  It was a great meal!"
93249,"I used the whole loaf, and the ranch mix is very salty. Next time I'll check to see if there is a low-sodium mix or try to make my own."
93249,This was incredibly tasty.  I used an indoor grill and grilled it.  I loved it for a yummy treat
93249,My family loves this.  This is one of our favorites breads.  This is even good with Spaghetti.
333281,"These were pretty good, but took forever to bake.  I would send it ended up being almost an hour!  Even then, the brownies stuck to the foil, and were on the overly moist side and not easy to cut.  They did taste quite rich, though!  Made for My 3 Chefs."
103948,"Great recipe. Family liked the 2 meats together.I used the slow oven method. Thanks MarieAlice, I will be making this again."
103948,"This was good, but somehow was not something I'd like to try again. It seemed like a nice idea, but I think I prefer beef and chicken separate. Sorry to sound like a picky child, but I guess we are all different. Thank you for the interesting experience."
103948,"My husband was thrilled! His mother used to make something like this on special occasions and this gave him a taste of his childhood.  Easy to make, a little time consuming, but well worth it. Delicious, absolutely delicious!!"
495314,Another great sauce for ribs! All the flavors blended nicely together and it was a snap to make. I used it as a mop sauce on grilled baby back ribs. Thanks for sharing and Good Luck in the contest.
59534,"Okay first all my substitutions: Halved the recipe for Hubby and me, used 6 button mushrooms sliced and sauted with the onion and garlic instead of canned mushrooms, used 8 ounces tri-coloured twisty pasta instead of cappelletti or elbow macaroni (I've only ever seen straight macaroni here), half a can of weight watcher's tomato soup, and I used half of a 200g can of chopped tomatoes. This is a very nice, filling dish - there wasn't a need for bread on the side for us! I baked it in an 8x8inch pan since I don't have a 3 qt casserole dish. The cheese wasn't too thick which was nice. The sweetness of the corn pairs nicely with the acidicity of the canned tomatoes."
59534,"I have a mazetti recipe of my own but decided to try this one as it called for different ingredients than mine. This recipe was VERY GOOD, but I still prefer my own which is posted here on recipe*zarr along with another chef's version. I will keep this recipe in my recipe box as hubby likes this one as well as mine.....and it will be nice to have a different flavor in mazetti once in awhile. I prepared this as written but did use the tri-colored pasta as I thought the picture was so pretty and yummy looking."
59534,"I'm giving this a five not because it is gourmet cuisine or anything, but because my pantry has a lot more space now and the results of this dish, as DH put it were ""very addictive"".  I was short on noodles, so I used the noodles from 2 boxes of mac and cheese and it seemed to be the perfect amount!  I WILL be making this again!"
69190,Sara I tried this and loved it darlin post some more
69190,"I love this recipe!  I love white clam chowder and thought this has the same delicious taste without the clams!  Thanks so much for this recipe, just love this and definitely keeping for a soup I will be making during the winter months!  Thanks Sara"
112959,"Very Good! Used as a veggie dip and as a topping for rice & bean burrito's.  Very versatile, the uses are endless!"
112959,"Oh my goodness! This recipe was very good! It does go bad within 24 hours, I think because of the lime/lemon juice. Next time I make it, I am going to add the lime/lemon juice only to the dip I will be using right then to see if it will keep longer. I did not add the hot sauce since I don't like spicy n it was great without it. I used it as a dip for some vegetarian southwestern eggrolls I made...Yum!"
112959,"Clearly a very forgiving as well as tasty recipe... it was really good, in spite of (my) chef error. I accidentally picked up firm tofu instead of silken, so my dip was not nearly as smooth as it should have been. I also had to compensate for that error by adding a bit more salsa for the liquid. In spite of all that, it had quite a good flavor and was very much enjoyed in our house. I will certainly make it again sometime... using the CORRECT kind of tofu, of course. ;)"
112959,"I made this today and it was AMAZING! I used the cilantro that comes in a tube so it was just a matter of tossing everything in the food processer, pulsing a few times and done. Light and fresh. This will definitely replace my guacamole recipe. I plan on using it as a dressing for Southwestern Black Bean and Brown Rice Wraps. Yum!"
62368,"I substituted absolutely everything I could for fat free.  I used fat free cream cheese, 1 c. of fat free egg substitute, fat free condensed milk, fat free sour cream, and even fat free margarine with fat reduced cookies.  It was unbelievable.  It didn't last through one evening in my house, because my son had two friends over and my daughter was home.  It's going to be really easy to substitute the chocolate and cookies and create other flavors using this basic recipe.  Can't thank you enough for posting this.  What a winner."
62368,"Another note to this recipe, as it was asked it the ""talk"" area...you can make the topping while your oven is still at baking temp... just after the cheesecake is done. Let it cool for a bit though first(at least 10 mins.)Kind of seems to make more sense to do it while your oven is ready.I have done the entire cheesecake the night before, all the steps....right down to melting more chocolate chips to drizzle over the sour cream topping and then have refrigerated it overnight before serving and i have also refrigerated it overnight just as is and then did the topping and chocolate & strawberries the next morning, both to no problems and with the same end result... a great cheesecake! Hope you all enjoy this cheesecake as much as i have...I have had great results with this recipe!"
62368,"This couldn't have been easier to make. Love it, Love it, Love it! The only thing I think I'd change next time is it was a little too chocolatey (who knew that was even possible). I'd use graham crackers or something besides the oreos for the crust. Thanks so much - "
62368,"I made this cheesecake for my cousin's birthday because he loves cheesecake...it was a good cheesecake and looked very nice when plated-up w/ the chocolate drizzled on top, whipped cream and a chocolate sauce on the plate.  This is the first time I made a cheesecake using sweetened condensed milk...i don't know if I like it as much as one's without (my own personal preference), but it was still good and everyone who has had it has liked it (thats the only reason I'm giving this a 4*).  Oh, I laos didnt have any oreo's so I used crushed graham crackers and mixed with butter and soem cocoa powder."
62368,"This was great! I have never made a cheesecake and this was so easy and it turned out so pretty, my question was about the cookie crust, I ended up scraping the filling out, it was very good!"
62368,"What a wonderful cheesecake! I served it at a dinner party and everyone loved it. I baked it earlier in the week, froze it, then let it thaw in the fridge the day before. Perfect! Thank you for an excellent recipe. Dottie 2"
62368,"I was wanting to submit this recipe but saw all the other chocolate chip cheesecake recipes so decided not to and read this one and it's exactly like mine. I got it from my mother many, many years ago. The only difference is the topping is new so I guess I'll have to try it, however, this dessert is SOOOOOO rich anyway, I don't think it really needs it but I'll still try it anyway. Trust me, it's YUMMY!"
62368,"This is a great recipe! I was looking for something 'different' in a cheesecake(I usually make fruit based ones) and this was it! I used white/milk chocolate swirl chocolate chips (all I had on hand), 1/3 fat 'Neufch√É¬¢tel' cream cheese, and did not use the topping. I practically had to padlock the fridge to keep my husband from eating it all! ;) Thanks for a great recipe!!"
62368,"Just took this to a get-together, and there wasn't a piece left. Very yummy."
62368,"Made this for my husbands birthday, it was easy to put together and tasted great.  I followed your directions exactly except that I put the topping on when it came of the oven and put it back in for 10 minutes right away, instead of waiting until it had cooled and chilled.  My husband LOVED it!  I couldn't find oreo cookie crumbs and I really didn't want to make my own, so I used chocolate grahm cracker crumbs.  It worked out fine, but I know the oreo crumbs would have been way better.  You could add just about anything to the base of the cheesecake, it is really versitle. Thanks!"
62368,Made this for my boyfriend's birthday last night. I wish I had let it set overnight instead of for about 5 hours. I skipped the topping (I'm not fond of sour cream topping on cheesecake) but everybody said it was good so thanks! :-)
62368,"Very decadent and rich cheesecake! Super easy to assemble, too. The only thing I did differently from the recipe is that I didn't make the topping. I was intending to put it on at the last ten minutes of baking (as the idea of chilling it first then putting it back in the oven seems like it would negatively affect the texture of the cake...??) but forgot about it until I got to step 8. I also had to use another half cup of cookie crumbs and a little more butter to cover the bottom of my 8"" pan. Other than that, great recipe!"
62368,Wonderful recipe!!!  I was not fond of the topping but it was easy enough to leave off.  Thanks for posting!
62368,Yum-O!  I used mini chocolate chips and a graham cracker crust and this was outstanding!  It didn't last long in our house!
62368,Oh man was this cheesecake good!! I let it refrigerate overnight before serving it for dessert for company. Everyone raved about how good it was. It was my first time making a cheesecake and it was really easy! I used mini chocolate chips and I left off the topping so I can't comment on that. I'll definitely be looking for excuses to make this again! :-D
62368,"Yummy! This is actually the second time I've made this, but I forgot to review it the first time. I used Recipe #7537 for the crust. I made half of this with chocolate chips and half plain because my boyfriend prefers plain cheesecake. I served with whipped cream, and it was just delicious!"
62368,"I made a graham cracker crust; used about 5 Tbs of melted butter and added in a couple Tbs of sugar.  I also omitted the topping as I was out of sour cream; the flavors are very good already, so I don't think it really needs the topping!  :o) The cream cheese flavor was a little strong for my tastes, so I think next time I'll use 2 pkgs of cream cheese and reduce the vanilla.  Still very good, though!"
62368,Very good indeed!  This was my first cheesecake and it turned out so beautifuly that one of my guests asked me where I bought it.  I didn't make the topping but I drizzled chocolate on it before serving.  Thank you for posting this recipie!
62368,"This was great...even with the few changes I made. I was lazy and didn't want to go to the store for Oreos so I made a graham cracker crust. 2 of my cream cheese packages were low-fat and my condensed milk was non-fat.  I did add a few more chocolate chips (probably negating my low-fat dairy choices).  And, my dinner guests had to cancel...I won't admit how much of this cake I ate. But I didn't gain an ounce the next morning!  That makes this recipe a keeper!"
62368,Very rich and yummy!!!!  I would cut down the chocolate chips a little on the inside. Melted the remainder on top tasted great !!!!
62368,"I didn't really care for this for some reason.  I love cheesecake and chocolate, but this wasn't hitting the spot for me.  Everyone loved it though, so you still get 4 stars ;)  Thanks for making the family happy."
111875,"Wonder what he'd think about the fat free yogurt and natural peanut butter? :-) Personally I find this so good that I'm at a loss for words...uh, a Little Less Conversation, a little more slurping...YUM."
111875,"This smoothie saved me!  I had surgery and could only have liquids, but wasn&#039;t allowed ice cold (had to avoid the &#039;brain freeze&#039;).  They suggested that I drink ENSURE meal replacement.  In a word-gross! I just couldn&#039;t get it down. My DH found this recipe - no ice!- , approved it with the surgeon&#039;s office and we were off!  I substituted the milk with the ENSURE and it was delish! We had to increase the ENSURE in the beginning to make it liquidy enough to easily drink with a straw.  Once I was allowed to drink from a glass we returned to 1/2 cup, and the thick and creamy texture was so satisfying.   As time went on, we switched up the flavours, using strawberry yogurt and ENSURE, and chocolate ENSURE.  They all tasted great, and I&#039;m sure this was one of the reasons that I healed so quickly.  I was back at work in 5 weeks instead of 8.  Even my surgeon&#039;s office said they would start adding this as a recommended option to help patients remain compliant to the liquid restriction.  Thanks so much."
136602,Where do I send my money???!!! This is the Best Margarita Bread I have ever had!(Actually the only Margarita bread I've ever had but I can't imagine anything better!) I did my best to mess up the recipe and it still came out wonderful- Including letting the mixer go and go with out turning it off and adding the sugar into the tequila instead of beating it with the shortening. Even after all my mistakes it still came out fabulous! The flavor is incredible-and the spread takes it over the top! Thank you for sharing San Marcos Sun!
136602,"If Sunshine says it's gonna' be good-take it to the bank, it's gonna' be GOOD.  I made a quadruple batch and got 4ea 8"" and 1ea 9"" loaves; 1 for Christmas brunch and 4 to give as superior gifts along with a carton of the cream cheese spread for every loaf.  I sampled the brunch loaf and sampled again and then had to square off my slanted cut and, you know...  This is quite possibly the finest thing ever done with a pkg. of dates.     27* Fabulous.  need a nap..."
136602,"The bread is flavorful, but quite dry. Probably because it only contains 2 tablespoons of shortening. It was better the second day after baking, but not something I would like to try again. With the cream cheese spread, I would say 4 stars, without, 3. Proof again that we're all different. Thank you for an interesting experience. I think I'll go with a plain date nut bread from now on."
48156,"I am just begining to learn a bit about Ayurveda, and I don't really feel like I can comment on the 'emotional balancing' effects of this.  But I can tell you, it tastes great!  I used it in Coconut Rice (Nasi Lemak)  #69488 (which calls for a similar spice mixture) and it was terrific.  I have also added it to some sauteed veggies, and it is also very nice.  Rich flavors, not too spicy and just plain tasty.  I have to say, I did not add the black cumin, but I can see how that would be a nice addition.  Thanks for posting, Mini!  I'm glad I have a nice jar of this in the cupboard for future use."
48156,This is the fourth or fifth time that I have made a double batch of this recipe! I use the black cumin (available at any indian grocery) and it helps to create a really intriguing and unique flavor.
48156,This looked very interesting and a good way to use up those herbs in the cabinet. I've mainly used it on veggies and will use again. Thanks.
33165,"Wow!  This is my new favorite potato salad.  I like that it doesn't have eggs and all their fat and cholesterol.  I omitted the pimentoes and garlic.  I used non-fat yogurt, non-fat sour cream and non-fat mayonnaise.  I substituted apple cider vinegar.  It was soooo fast and easy to prepare.  I'm lazy and I didn't have a problem with this.  It fits right in with my low to no-fat diet.  Thanks. I don't know how I lived without this."
33165,"Best fat free potato salad I've ever had (and I've had a bunch!).  I used all fat free products and it was super creamy and flavorful.  The combination of mayo, sour cream, and yogurt allowed it to not taste like fat free mayo.  I'll make this again."
33165,"I made this for a luncheon for thirty seniors. They-and the kitchen staff- loved it. I used 90 small red potatoes, cut them in quarters and quadrupled the rest of the ingredients. I didn't use pimentos or garlic. It was awesome. Not even a spoonful left!!! I will definately make this again for church functions and for family gatherings. Thanks Carrie Ann-I'll even pass it on to my TOPS friends."
33165,I really like this recipe. I did use light Miracle Whip because we really don't like the taste of fat-free mayo. I also made 1 1/3 batch to make it extra moist. It was good and an excellent alternative to the full fat recipes that try to give you cardiac arrest-) Thanks Carrie Ann for posting this. I Made this a long time ago and forgot to review it. Good alternative for those of us watching our weight.
33165,Great lowfat/fat free option.  I used fat free sour cream and fat free yogurt- which made the sauce thinner- so I added a few more potatoes.  Wonderful.
43164,"  This is also one of my favorite episotes, I'll try this recipe as soon as I can find some veal!!  I live in a very small town!!Thank You.  I'm so excited to find this."
31490,"Have not tried this, but it sounds delicious. Reminds me of a layover I had at the Atlanta airport.  I had a ham, egg, and cheese pizza at one of the pizza chain places on the concourse.  About $2.99 with coffee... It was one of the best breakfast dishes I ever had!  (But a strange place to find a delicious breakfast...lol)"
31490,This recipe was wonderful.  Instead of using the precooked sausage I substituted uncooked sausage then cooked and drained it. It turned out perfect!
31490,"We liked this, but the I only baked for 15 minutes and the crust was too browned on the bottom.  That could be my oven, but I haven't had issues in the past.  I too used uncooked sausage, but cooked it first and also added a few slices of cooked bacon pieces.  Tastes like the one at the local gas station.  Thanks for such an easy recipe."
31490,"No leftovers here. As Coleen114 mentioned this cooks fast. 10 minutes total for us till it was perfect brown but if we hadn't been watching it could have been disaster. Ovens vary but we had ours higher up and it still cooked fast. Thanks for posting Aroostook. It was perfect served with fruit salad. Kids and adults alike loved it. We could only find the pizza dough with one more ounce than called for so I made the crust built up a bit. No problems at all. Easily could add or change omelet type toppings i.e mushrooms, peppers,etc. Don't forget to season with salt and pepper. Super all around. Made for Zaar Cookbook game in the community forum. Enjoy! ChefDLH"
35653,"Fast, easy, not too sweet!"
306168,This was one of the best broccoli casseroles that I have ever made.  I made my own chicken soup for this recipe. I was a bit worried about the tsp of soy sauce but it gave the casserole the best flavor. YUM!    The photos you took (shapeweaver) inspired me to make this recipe and it actually does look just like them when it comes out of the oven.    Thanks so much for sharing your recipe shapeweaver. It was wonderful!  Going into my family's favorite Zaar cookbook :)
306168,I made this for my son's first birthday party this weekend. Our guests INHALED it! Everyone kept saying how delicious it was. I was I could have gotten to try it.
306168,Loved this.  Be sure to completely thaw the broccoli.  I didn&#039;t and it didn&#039;t get done in time specified.  Just cooked it a little longer though and it was perfect.  Thanks Chef.
306168,"5 stars from my husband and son, my toughest critics. I used a 10-oz bag of chopped broccoli and a 10-oz bag of flowerettes which gave it more texture. Very good flavor and the smell while cooking was great. The sauce held it together without overwhelming the broccoli."
116679,"Very delicious casserole! Creamy, tasty and cruncy, all at the same time. The chestnuts added crunchynes, but they don't really contribute a lot to the flavor, so I wouldn't worry too much, if I didn't have them on hand, next time."
116679,"I am so glad that I tried this because it's one of the best broccoli casseroles that I've ever tasted!  I used reduced-fat versions of the cream cheese and sour cream.  I used fresh broccoli flowerets.  I was worried that it may be too salty, but it was just right.  Thanx for sharing this awesome recipe.  It's a keeper!"
116679,"I had a recipe yrs ago like this but lost it! THIS was fabulous!!!! The recipe I had used broccoli & cauliflower and didn't have water chestnuts in it. I liked the water chestnuts, added a nice crunchy texture to the recipe. I followed your recipe exactly and will make it again for sure! Thanks for a 5 + star recipe!!!!"
116679,This is absolutely fantastic!!!
116679,Excellant! I made the  recipe using fresh broccoli and leaving out the water chestnuts. It was delicious.
105069,"I made this thinking it would be fun to make a polish dish for my part polish husband. We liked it a lot. I used button and bella mushrooms. I would add more sour cream next time and maybe omit the lemon juice, but it was great as is too!"
35595,"This is a wonderful gravy!  Very easy to make.  I was skepical of the tomato sauce in it, but it works very well.  I didn't have any white wine so used red.  Delicious with my veggie 'chicken' but I can't wait to try it with potatoes or rice."
35595,"Absolutely horrible.  I wasted time and ingredients on this.  If you're wondering how a mushroom gravy with a tomato base would work, don't.  "
35595,"Pretty good, but I also added bigger pieces of mushroom at the end, along with coarse sliced onions and subbed some sriracha sauce and oriental broth for tobasco and veggie broth. Ended up being pretty good."
5060,why no walnuts??? omega 3 fatty acids...let's compromise and make it half walnuts half pecans
500166,I doubled the recipe for my family but used two pounds of meat instead of 1.5 pounds. I followed the recipe except we did not use the onions and topped them with sour cream. I also didn&#039;t make the corn. We all enjoyed these.
64302,I made this salad to take to a pool party today. It was a nice change from the usual mayo or Italian dressing macaroni salad. Everyone really enjoyed it. I will certainly make this one again. Thanks for posting.
64302,I cut this recipe in half since I was making for just me and I loved it. The dressing reminds me of the Western French Dressing that is one of my favorites. Thanks for the recipe. Next time I'll have to make the whole recipe.
64302,Terrific hit with salad beans!
64302,"I first had this at my parent's house and was pleasantly surprised! Add a couple of tins of shrimp or some fresh cooked shrimp, lobster or crab and it's fabulousness increases exponentially!"
47366,"This is pretty good!  I made a couple of minor substitutions:  I don't have beef bouillion because I usually have beef stock on hand, so I used the stock instead of the water and bouillion.  If I were to use bouillion, I would leave out the 2-1/2 tsp salt.  I seared the beef in a skillet on high heat, then deglazed the pan with a little red wine, putting that in the crockpot, too.  I added garlic and used fresh herbs.  The Beau had 3 helpings!"
47366,This recipe isn't very tasty and no one was impressed. I have had much better minestrone soup. I won't bother with this recipe again. It just didn't have the right taste to us-bland. Sorry.
100540,"well, this is it if you want grilled cheese in a hurry and it doesn't get any simpler.  I've been making this for years actually, and prefer it with a really good sharp cheddar or thick-cut Gouda on multi-grain bread."
100540,This was so easy! My son gobbled it right up.
100540,This is so quick and easy! Such a great remedy to waiting for a frying pan to heat up! I have a coworker that uses this shortcut all the time for his grandson's grilled cheese sammiches.  I have tried it out and it is a true lifesaver!
100540,For ease this gets a five. I tried it thinking it would not be any good this way. I was shocked...it was actually very tasty and quick. I made one for my kids and they loved it. I am assuming it could possibly be lower in fat made this way if you go way easy (or omit)the butter. Yummy & quick!   
100540,very nice alternative to heating up the stove top. thank you for such a neat idea. 
100540,"LOL...This is wonderful.  When the stove is clean and all of the pans are put away, you can still enjoy melted cheese.  I've been making these for over twenty years and still enjoy them..  Try different cheeses and different seasonings too."
100540,I also used some shredded cheddar along with the american--was amazed how quick and tasty it was...
100540,"I had this for breakfast and it was delicious and so quick and easy! I wanted something a little more substantial than plan ol' toast and this fit the bill perfectly! I used low calorie honey wheat bread, fat free American cheese and butter spray. So not not only was this yummy, it was low calorie too! Thanks so much for posting this!"
100540,"When you're hungry and in a hurry, this recipe will take care of both those problems for you.  There was some provolone  leftover from last weeks sandwiches, so I used up today.  I had to try this using the butter for the kids.  But for myself, I have been making mine dry for the last 5 years, no butter, as I like to cut calories whenever I can.  Made for *Zaar Cookbooks Tag 2009* game"
100540,"Oh so simple! This was probably the fastest lunch I've ever made, lol. Fast, simple, good - what else is there?! Thanks MaeEast for a great quick lunch! Made for Adopt a Tag 2009."
83025,"Sorry folks ... I tried this recipe and it fell woefully short of the mark. I grew up in Winnipeg and had Jeanne's cakes at every family function for years. Now that I live in Florida, I was delighted to see a recipe for the cake and wonderful frosting so that I could have a taste of home. The cake, as described in this recipe, makes a tasty cake but it is more like a pound cake than Jeanne's  cake. The base wasn't quite right either. The frosting was close. All in all, an OK recipe for a cake, but if you are looking to replicate a Jeanne's cake, your search isn't over. This recipe doesn't cut it."
83025,I made this for my daughter for her birthday and we all felt it was really close to the original cake.  We live in Winnipeg and always purchased Jeanne's cake for our family's birthday.  We have found over the years that Jeanne's cake is tasting different.  I don't think they use butter anymore.  I used 1/3 cup of butter in the base instead of shortening. and 1/2 cup of butter in the cake instead of shortening. It tasted very close to the cake I used to have when I was a kid.
83025,"I'm looking forward to trying this recipe. I'll update the stars when I do. My husband is from Winnipeg and he says he grew up with this cake. Thanks for posting!  I made the cake today. Since I've never had a Jeanne cake, I can't tell how they compare. I like the cake. It came out dense, but I may be used to box cakes."
83025,"I have never had a ""Jeanne's"" cake before, but I thought that this cake was very tasty. I took the advice to use butter instead of shortening in the base and cake."
83025,"It took me about 4 hours to make this cake and it was AWFUL!  I made this for my mother's birthday and NO ONE liked it. It is definitely an acquired taste! If you're not used to this cake or have never tried it--be aware and try a ""dry run"" before using this recipe for a big event. It has no real flavor and I did even use the chocolate shavings. I guess you could say that it has a very ""delicate"" flavor. Anyway, as I said if this is not a cake that you've had before and loved it, try it before the big event to make sure that you like it. The frosting was very interesting though and I might try messing with it to make similar light frosting but with more of a bold flavor."
83025,"I grew up in Wpg and was pleased to see a recipe for the Jeanne cakes I have come to adore over the years. But I agree with the other reviewers... although a tasty cake (not too sweet) and close to the original, it doesn't quite cut it - something is missing. I thought the icing was really good, but I had trouble coloring it and I'm not sure why -it seemed to separate. I have made many types of icing over the years and have not run into this. I use Wilton and Americolor gel colors."
83025,"I also grew up in Winnipeg, but moved away long ago. I have tried this recipe and it is exactly like the bakery cake. The first thing you must know is, you have to use a Kitchen Aid Stand Mixer for this cake and frosting. Do not try this recipe unless you have one, because you will fail. Bake the cake in a glass pan, it will end up lighter and more fluffy.  Make sure you whip the cake batter for at least 5 minutes till fluffy. I always use whipping cream instead of milk, but you can always go half and half to make up the milk measurement. You must cut the edges, top and bottom off the cake once it has cooled. The original cake never had crisp sides or top so you must cut them off, if you have a Lab they will love you for the cake scraps. Jeanne's cake is very bland, so you could always substitute pure orange extract into the recipe to add flavor. When you make the frosting, again you must use a Kitchen Aid Stand Mixer. At the original bakery they are not using some wimpy set of beaters to make the icing. The icing will separate if you add food coloring so be careful. I don't know which brand of coloring they use, so I always leave the icing just white."
306245,"Extremely simple,  and lovely taste, I love nutmeg with spinach, and sauteed in butter, yum, delcious.  I scaled down the recipe for 2,   I was sparing with the water, only adding what I felt I needed,  and I used baby spinach leaves.   Lovely recipe, thank you docholliday!    Made for PAC Spring 2012"
52443,This was very tasty.  I decided to double up the recipe and add some chopped pepperoni sausage and we made a full meal out of it.  It is not filling enough for a mainmeal without it.
52443,"I agree with silky's review.  Very tasty indeed.  I think next time I will add some chopped pepperonis, as she suggested, and possibly ramp up the garlic powder and oregano for a more intense flavor.  When doubled up, this makes a great no-leftovers meal for 2!  Also there is minimal cleanup afterwards--always a plus!"
87098,"This was great, certainly a time saver not having to do all that chopping! I added cooked ground beef and cooked macaroni so that my husband would eat it.  Thanks SmrJunior!"
87098,"This was a good base soup. I followed the recipe except I didn't have canned zucchini, so used peas. I also used fresh shredded carrots and celery as they needed to be used up. I used diced tomatoes with oregano and basil but we thought the soup needed a lot more seasoning. I did add some salt and pepper but it still was missing something. This also reheated nicely for lunches. I also simmered mine a lot longer then the recipe called for. I simmered for about an hour. I too added hamburger so my family would be happy."
286009,don't let the calories and fat grams scare you off. This is a wonderful recipe and is perfect for the summer cook-out topped with fresh berries! It will make you proud. This is meant to be shared!
144952,Delicious
144952,"Absolutely delicious.  We used tons of cheese (not sure if we followed the recipe on that!) and followed the recipe exactly otherwise.  It wasn't very hard to make, it took a while but wasn't much work.  Yummy, and we got 4 servings as well."
33606,"This was worth more than 5*, I took it to a luncheon at work today, there was not a speck left.Everyone loved the fact that it was not the ordinary mayo laden pasta salad. There was lots of crunch with the peppers and water chestnuts; the dill pickles and black olives with the spices livened it up. I used cubed smoked chicken and cubed sharp cheddar.  The only thing I did differently was to add 3 tablespoons of hot relish to give it a little bite.  We all enjoyed it very much and will make it again for a large gathering; it does make a lot!!  Thanks for sharing."
33606,This was wonderful!  We enjoyed this tremendously on a hot summer night.  Good flavor combo.
30131,Why haven't I reviewed this before?  I've used it on both chicken and steaks and it is a terrific marinade.  Thanks for posting.
30131,I used it on shrimp and even though it turned them a bit brown they tasted great. Can't wait to try it on some beef. Thank you.
522861,"This was wonderful momaphet.  We enjoyed this tasty dish very much.  Made exactly as written and wouldn&#039;t change a thing.  Served with apple sauce on the side.  OMG, The flavor from the garlic, cheese, fried onions and apple sauce  is out of this world good.  We enjoyed it very much and will be having this again often. Who knew that apple sauce with noodles would be so comforting.  Thank you for sharing this lovely recipe.  Made for CQ2 - Family Picks."
109439,"I tried this on a turkey sandwish, but I thought the horseradish was a little to over powering."
18537,This was a great recipe.  It was easy to prepare and tasted wonderful.  I only had plain applesauce so I add 1/4 tsp cinnamon to the applesauce also.  It turned out really well.
18537,"I used chicken breasts, as we don't eat pork .. cooked it in the crockpot on low for 7 hours .. very easy and good .."
18537,"These were simple to make.  DH loved the flavor of apples with the pork.  I used canned ""fried apples"" that were nice and chunky.  It worked out well."
18537,"Made the wait forever porkchops my husband and kids did not like them, found the clove flavour over powering"
18537,"I used apricots instead of applesauce, added cinnamon & ginger & left out the cloves (I don't like them personally).  It was great & easy to prepare."
18537,"Great simple do ahead recipe.  I used a fresh apple, peeled it and coarsley chopped it pot the apple over the browned chop,in a baking dish added cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg, covered the dish and baked in 300F oven fo almost 2 hours - result- moist tasty chop- It's a winner Terri F -"
18537,"It was great!!!! I was looking for a recipe for pork chops and I spotted this one. Its was easy,fast, and good."
18537,Made this for the family tonight and they loved it... I did make extra applesauce  and used it to spoon over the pork chops as goober sauce. I served the chops with mashed sweet potatoes with the goober sauce over them... YUMMY
18537,Awesome!  My whole family loves this recipe.  The pork came out perfectly tender.  Used just regular applesauce.  The only thing I did differently was use cinnamon instead of cloves.
177187,"Thanks for sharing this recipe Sara!!  I am a Scot, living in Cairo for the past 6 or 7 years, and I remember making this recipe.  It was modified to Imperial measurements and they substituted Cadbury's chocolate for the American brand. If I recall correctly, it appeared in a Sunday supplement.  I mislaid this recipe during my move here.  Also since I moed here, I cook using the cup measurements.  To find them here for this recipe makes it much easier for me.  These are the most perfect, crispy but chewable cookies I have ever tasted, and my kids enjoy helping me prepare them!"
177187,"My nieghbor gave me this recipe.I halved the recipe,makes 65 cookies exactly .My nieghbors recipe used 8oz hershey. I used hershey kisses left over from? ,put them in the food processor and chopped into small pieces.Also used the processor for oatmeal and ground into a fine powder..I did not refrigerate...Put I did pam spray the cookie sheets.Used my cookie scoop....Took longer than 6minutes,more like 10-12. But my oven temp could be off alittle..My DH doesnt like alot of choclate chips in cookies..When I make cookies he says they are called chocolate chip cookies,(meaning 1 chip per cookie) but he liked this recipe. I think it was the oat flour ,gives the cookie a almost healthy flavor...I will make these again...Well,worth making..."
39959,"This certainly is a blessing!  I had to omit the burnet root as I could not find it.  I've been taking it by just putting a half tsp in my mouth and then washing it down with some cold water and then some hot water.  I think the hot water is a necessary step- it really makes me feel like this is working a bit more and has really gotten washed down.  Be forewarned-  don't try and make a tea out of this! I tried that... ewwwwwww.  Bitter, bitter, bitter!  So, stick with taking it with some water or putting it in a gelatin tablet.  It works wonders though- I really feel that when I take it I find that my mind feels much clearer and I feel more like I can take on the task at hand, rather than panicking.  When I took this before bed, I found that I slept much more soundly and woke up feeling much more refreshed.  Thank you, Sharon for this treasure."
54100,"I really enjoyed these burgers.  The taste was great, I think it was the dry mustard.  When I went to make them I didn't have any onions, but they still tasted good.  The big shocker was picky eater son, ate the whole thing!  That speaks for itself!  Thanks for the terrific recipe."
54100,One word YUM!!! I'm not a huge fan of venison but I now know what to do with my freezer full.  Not gamey at all! Thank you-can't wait to make a big batch to freeze.
54100,What a great way to use up some ground venison. I was surprised that it didn't taste like venison when cooked.  I used my cast iron skillet to make them but DH and DS want them done on the grill next time.  They were quick and easy to make.  Thanks!
54100,"Very good burgers! I did cook them on the grill, though. I skipped the chopped onions to avoid complaints from my son, but used onion powder to add some flavor, and used real eggs instead of egg substitute. An employee of my husband gave us some ground venison, and I have little experience with it. We were all pleased with these burgers. Thanks! "
54100,"Sorry for the lower review, but I made it per the recipe and I have to so I was a little disappointed.The previous reviews gave me high expectations for a great burger. My family and I thought this tasted more like grilled meatloaf on a bun rather than a burger.  I compared the recipe to some meatloaf recipes and found them to be very similar.  The taste was fine, but not what I was hoping for."
54100,"This recipe inspired me to start using all the ground venison my mother-in-law has given me.  To accomodate my husband's allergies, I omitted the powdered milk and used a few egg yolks in place of the egg substitute.  The burgers had just the right consistency and a nice flavor."
54100,"These were good, but I agree, more of a meatloaf type flavor than we were looking for in a burger.  I think you could kick this up with the addition of some Tony's to get more of the flavor we were after."
54100,not sure what some people seem to be expecting that they would be so high-handed as to leave a lowly 3 star rating...someone gifted me some ground venison & this recipe was the perfect fit! Thanks for sharing!
54100,"These hamburgers were juicy and delicious.  The patties held together beautifully and everyone loved them.  I've tried other recipes and none have come close.  I was in a rush and used onion powder and a real egg because that's what I had.  I also used 2 lbs. of meat because of all the boys I have to feed, I did not increase the other ingredients.  I cooked them in a cast iron skillet with butter.  I'm saving this recipe!"
54100,"Modified this recipe to lessen the meatloaf association and turned out excellent.  Made 25 2.5 oz. mini-burgers from 4 lbs. ground deer (buck).    25 - 2.5oz. burgers   √Ç¬∑	4 lbs lean ground venison    √Ç¬∑	4 eggs √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú 1 egg per lb of deer  √Ç¬∑	6 tablespoons 2% milk √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú 2/3 tablespoons per lb of deer  √Ç¬∑	6 tablespoons water - 2/3 tablespoons per lb of deer  √Ç¬∑	1 1/3 cup breadcrumb √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú 1/3 per lb of deer  √Ç¬∑	1 cup finely chopped onion (only had one cup could use more)  √Ç¬∑	3/4 teaspoon salt √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú 1/5.3 teaspoon per lb of deer (good luck with that, ha)  √Ç¬∑	3/4 teaspoon black pepper √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú 1/5.3 teaspoon per lb of deer   √Ç¬∑	1 teaspoon dry mustard √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú √Ç¬º teaspoon per lb of deer  √Ç¬∑	1/2 teaspoon parsley √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú 1/8 teaspoon per lb of deerFollow mixing instructions. Slightly froze patties(about 1 hour) to ease transfer to grill.  Cooked ~5mins per side (medium well to well but very juicy).  Moved to low flame and added grilled onion and/or sliced Jalape√É¬±o peppers and covered with cheese of choice.  Melt cheese and serve.  Thanks for the starter recipe and all the reviews, they really helped."
54100,i used real egg and cooked them both from the udefrosted and frozen state on the GRILL on LOW and they turned out fabulous!  Everyone loved them!  so great to have a good venison burger recipe that doesn't crumble and fall apart!
54100,"I&#039;ve never made venison burgers before, chose this recipe.  Had to make a few modifications (i.e. real egg whites, etc.) that were minor due to items on hand.  Turned out great.  Cooked on the charcoal grill.  A little overdone, but that&#039;s the cook, not the recipe!  My son loved the burger and  that&#039;s enough proof for me.  Thank you, will make again for sure."
54100,"OMG! These are the best venison burgers I have ever tasted. I added some minced garlic to the recipe, just because I love it so much. I make large batches of these and freeze them so that when the craving hits I have them on hand (and yes, I do crave them from time to time)."
54100,Made these today for lunch with some ground venison a friend gave me- turned out great! Thanks for the recipe!
27087,"Thick is definitely accurate.  Not bad, but it was a little TOO much for my tastes.  It was so thick, it was a little hard to handle without making a mess.  Probably would not make again"
93959,"Awesome muffins!!  I have to be honest and say I was a little skeptical, mostly because I was unsure about the cocoa / yam / orange  combination, but it works, and really well I might add!  The flavors are subtle without being at all bland, and the streusel sets it off perfectly.  My yield was 13 muffins.  Subs:  1/2 c splenda + 1/4 c nonfat dry milk instead of sugar; 3 egg whites + 1 T liquid lecithin instead of 2 eggs."
93959,This is a light & tender muffin.  The spices were a bit strong for me and the streusal topping didn't work out.  I think that the butter needs to be cold and not soft so that it ends up more crumbly.  Mine was pasty.  I'd also double the streusal next time.
29214,"I'm so glad I picked this recipe for the ""pick a chef"" event.  I can't believe this wonderfully creamy and richly flavored mushroom sauce has'nt been reviewed yet.  It tastes much more decadent than the fat grams and calories would indicate.  The multiple reductions gave the mushrooms intense flavor, and the milk mixture provided a creamy texture.  Well worth the time to prepare.  I served it with plain pan-grilled pork chops and rice."
29214,I wish you would bottle this sauce - it was delicious over pork chops.  I was cooking the chops and some cabbage at the same time and I needed two more hands!
29214,Superb! Transforms every day steak and veg into an exceptional gourmet meal.
29214,"Wow, this sauce is amazing! Yes, it takes a bit longer than the usual sauce but it is very much worth it. A definite make again which can be served with so many things. I used the dry sherry and would highly recommend it. Thank you, Manda!"
29214,"I was browsing while waiting on hold, glanced at the recipe, and then had to look back once I was done with my call. I hadn't been looking for a dinner idea, but I realized I had everything for this recipe. I added an onion to the garlic (I used 6 cloves) and mushrooms at the beginning, and then tore up some ham pieces to throw in at the end. I cooked up some egg noodles, which I stirred together with the sauce, and then served with an additional sprinking of grated parm. It definitely tasted richer than its ingredients, and I think it's the bit of mustard, teriyaki, and herbs that gave it just a bit more complexity than is usual with this type of sauce. I guess it's the usual thing...if you're cutting out some fat, you have to add a bit more flavor in return. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
29214,this is phenomenal!
29214,I used this as my Beef Stroganoff sauce and it was great.  I just added in the ground beef and some onions and garlic and had it over noodles with sugar snap peas on the side.  Excellent!
29214,This is very good and I believe that it will taste good on all kinds of meat.  I am going to freeze a couple servings to see how it does.  Followed recipe exactly with portabellos but I skipped the milk powder and used 1% milk.  Thanks so much!
19208,"Very, very tasty! My mom used to do this... I used macintosh apples and regular white sugar. I have a food mill, so I cooked the apples and pureed them before adding anything else. I melted the candies in a small pan, then added them to the applesauce. After tasting that, I determined how much sugar I needed. (Not much.)"
45859,"This really is a truth serum!  Potent drink.  We use 1/2 can of fresh lime juice, 3/4 can of tequila and 1/2 can triple sec.  The regular dose was more potent than we could handle so we adjusted the amounts."
45859,"The BEST margarita recipe I have ever found.  Really fresh, authentic taste (I think from all the fresh lime juice).  Beats margarita mix any day!"
35173,My husband suggested using a little pizza sauce on the bread also.  Fairly easy sandwich to make.
83873,"This fried chicken lives up to its' name!!""Crispy and Crunchy""!!The cream of chicken soup gave the chicken a nice flavour.I didn't have cornstarch so I used flour in it's place and it still turned out.I used the chicken breasts as called for in the recipe,but I think next time I'm going to try it with chicken parts.I might even try and ""double-coat"" them for extra ""crunchiness""!!!!"
83873,This is fantastic!!!!!!!
83873,"Excellent fried chicken- very crispy and I love using the soup for dredging.  The chicken was a bit tastless though, so next time I will be sure to add more spices."
59952,"This was an easy, delicious casserole.  I think it would also be great as a burrito stuffing.  I may halve the amount of meat & add beans next time.  Great recipe!"
155959,Excellent marinade. We will be using this often. Marinated for 24 hours.
155959,The very Best!! I have tried to put this Marinade together many times! It tastes exactly like one I used to get at a specialty butcher. They called it Chicago Marinade. WOW!!! Thanks!
155959,"Very flavorful and juicy.  I marinated my beef for 20 hours, then brought it to room temp before grilling.  I added a pinch of sugar to the marinade, otherwise made it as written.  We'll be eating this again.  Thanx for sharing."
155959,"I made this today and it was fabulous! I served it with a sauce made of baby bella mushrooms with steak sauce, dry sherry and a touch of brown sugar. Boy was this good!"
155959,I have a similar recipe and it is also used for pork or lamb but it has 1/3 cup lemon juice and uses 1/4 red wine vinegar. Just a variation!
155959,"I didn't change a thing. Very flavorful marinade and the meat stayed sooo juicy. Why would anyone buy a bottled marinade...this took about 2 minutes to throw together. Thanks ""Ant"" Kelly!!"
155959,"This had great flavor, I will be making this again !!"
155959,I made this tonite and it was wonderful....we just fell in love with the marinade....great recipe
155959,"This is the most mild tasting marinade that I have tried so far.  Mixed it according to directions and marinaded my flank steak for about 8 hrs.  The taste was mild, but flavorful.  A great all around marinade that will please everybody.  Thanks for the recipe!"
155959,ALL I CAN SAY OHHHHH MYYYY GOOODD !!!!! I followed this recipe and I let the london broil sit in the marinate over night and the next done I cooked the london broil on a broiler pan and put the london broil in the oven OUTSTANDING DRLICOUS MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH!!!! thank you for a wonderful recipe!( I printed thw recipe and stuck the recipe on the fridge for quick access)
155959,"I made this last night for dinner. I thought I'd have some left-overs for lunch the next day. Boy, was I wrong. My family loved the steak so much, we completely scarfed the whole thing down. What a winning recipe! I love the flavor the balsamic vinegar & garlic gives the steak. I marinated it over night & broiled it to a perfect medium rare. Next time I think I'll grill it. YUM!! Thanks ""ant"" Kelly for a great recipe. ~from another ""ant"" Kelly"
155959,Very good!  We marinated for 24 hours and cooked it on our indoor Hamilton Beach for 8 minutes each side.  Done to perfection and very nice flavor.  Thanks for sharing
155959,This was an awesome marinade recipe!!  I marinated a london broil for 24 hours and threw it on the grill/ med/rare-was absolutely fantastic!!  Thankyou!!
155959,This is an excellent marinade! I loved it! Thank you very much.
155959,"Very tasty marinade; however, after marinading for three days, I expected the london broil to be tender.  It wasn't at all and it  was made it as written."
155959,"Very tasty, and a big hit with our dinner guests.  This is a nice way to make a tougher cut of meat into a very enjoyable and savory meal!"
155959,This marinade is wonderful!  I used it on london broil that I had cubed for kabobs and then we grilled them.  The meat was very flavorful and got rave reviews!
155959,"I let it cook too long, but it was super yummy anyway! I did not have the balsamic vinegar and didn't try a sub for it. Still wonderful!"
155959,"Excellent!  I had quite a plump cut of beef labeled ""London Broil"" and so scored it quite deeply, marinated it and grilled it longer than the stated 5-7 minutes per side.  I seared it over high heat on my gas grill for about 5 minutes per side and then roasted on indirect heat for another 20-30 minutes, until the internal temperature was about 110√Ç¬∞  It was still quite rare in the middle but that's OK with us because we eat the more cooked ends and then I use the leftover middle (rare) part sliced up in a stir-fry the next day.  We routinely do this with beef on the grill....the smoky-tasting grilled rare beef tastes great in a stir fry combined with some chicken, perhaps, or shrimp and whatever veggies are in season.  Thank you KJK#5 for posting this great marinade and directions, especially the camping directions!"
155959,"This marinade makes the most delicious tasting meat my hubby or I have ever had. Far better than any we've had at any restaurant and so easy to make! We like our meat cooked med-rare and it was so juicy and bursting with flavor! I took the little bit of left over meat, sliced it up, heated it in the microwave for about 35 seconds and added it to a romaine salad with tomatoes, cucumber a little mont. jack cheese and balsamic vinaigrette. It was still just as delicious. Thanks so much for the great recipe. I have been serching frantically for this recipe today because I couldn't find my print out. Everyone viewing this recipe, make sure you save this to your cookbook!  *UPDATE* I made this again with a 4.5 lb piece of London Broil 3 weeks ago when my hubby had a ""guy night"" at our home. He told me yesterday they are still talking about it, saying it was the most tender and flavorful meat they've ever had (I marinated it for 3 days in a 13x9 dish, flipping every 12 hours spooning the marinade into the scores on top each time). They were asking when they can come over for it again. Served with garlic parmesean mashed potatoes and grilled corn on the cob. Perfect ""Man Meal"". Thanks again."
155959,I picked this recipe to make for my DH's birthday dinner and we both loved it.  Our grill ran out of gas so I ended up broiling it and the meat came out perfect. I served sauteed mushrooms and onions alongside.   Thank you for posting a keeper!
155959,Very very good.  The whole family loved this and I gave out the recipe!  Thanks so much!
155959,"This was the best London Broil Marinade I have ever made. Just delicious!. I even overcooked the meat a bit, but it didn't get dry or tough. We used leftover steak for steak sandwiches the next day and it tasted so great I didn't wan to cover it up with steak sauce."
155959,London Broil was on sale and I remembered this recipe so I grabbed a slab and headed to Recipezaar! This marinade was wonderful. I ended up marinating the steak for about 36 hours. I would make this again. THanks chef!
155959,"With high hopes, in light of the great reviews, we tried this over the weekend.  Marinated a little longer than specified and it still did not make our london broil tender - or flavorful.  The directions were followed exactly and cooked under the broiler.  We ended up throwing out.  Sorry, this did not work for us at all."
155959,"This is a great marinade! Made with ingredients I always have on hand and the house smells amazing while it's broiling. Thanks, Shwana, for inspiring your ""ant"" to post this recipe!"
155959,This recipe turned out great and I know we will be using it again soon! Thanks for another 'go to' marinade : )
155959,"I tried this tonight and it turned out fantastic!  The meat was tender, moist, and very flavorful. I will be using this recipe over and over. Thanks ""Ant"" Kelly for sharing this with us all!"
155959,"I actually made this for a OAMC meal and froze the London Broil in the marinade.  Turned out delicious.   Not an over powering marinade at all, still left the taste of the beef come through.  Think I may try this marinade with a pork loin in the future.    Will definately make again."
155959,This is a really good marinade.  It's also very simple (which makes it even better).  It gave the meat a great flavor without being overpowering.  Will definitely use this recipe again.  Thanks for posting it.
155959,Wow! This recipe is great! I've never had beef turn out quite as flavorful and tender as it does with this marinade and cooking method. We are low-carb eaters and sometimes we reduce the amount of balsamic vinegar to lower the carbs. Any suggestions on an herb other than Rosemary just for a change? We make this A LOT and I am ready to switch things up a little. Thank you very much for sharing!  :)  Chris
155959,"This recipe was delicious.  The balsamic vinegar gave the meat just a hint of sweetness, which made it oh so good.  This will be the way I make my London Broil from now on."
155959,"The marinade was very tasty, but I found that the cooking time was quite off.  My london broil was just over 2 lbs. I grilled it for 7 minutes on each side, and it still came out rare.  Thanks for the recipe!"
155959,I had the opposite problem from one of the other reviewers. I purchased a top quality Black Angus flank steak that weighed a tad over 2 pounds. I marinated the steak for 24 hours and grilled it for exactly 5 minutes per side. The meat was well done and tough. We did like the marinade so I'm giving it 4 stars. Next time I'll look for a thicker piece of meat and try this again. Thanks for sharing.
155959,"This is my wife's favorite dish that I make, now.  Thanks for sharing it."
155959,Too bad I can't give this recipe more than 5 stars.  Very easy to prepare and excellent blend of flavors in the meat.  I bought the top round rather than flank steak and it was very tender and juicy.  Will definitely make this again.
155959,Really really delicious tender steaks!  We love this marinade!
155959,"This was pretty good and very easy!  Personally, I didn't care too much for the sweetness of the balsamic vinegar, but that's not a fault with the recipe- just a personal taste.  I'm going to try it again with a bit less vinegar and maybe some more worcestershire."
155959,"Made this in bulk for labor day, cooked it ahead and everyone was scarfing it up.  Shared the recipe with several friends.  Thanks KJK for sharing."
155959,This is so incredibly flavorful!  I don't much care for rosemary so just added a sprig rather than mincing it.  It smelled and tasted wonderful!
155959,I agree with everyone-delicious marinade! I added chopped shallots and 1 tablespoon brown sugar.
155959,"We marinated for 4 hours and took it to my boyfriends mothers and grilled, she was very impressed, we all loved it, the combination of spices were wonderful"
155959,This was amazing my husband and son could not stop eating the broil. Thank you for sharing the recepy. Simple and delicious.
155959,"This marinade is just perfect. I have tried @ least 5 different marinades before trying this one and I always feel like I have to keep looking for the perfect blend of herbs, spices and flavor. Well, I have stopped looking, this is it for me there is no flavor that overwhelms, it's tastes just the way a steak should taste. I loved it, my picky daughter loved it and I can't wait to make it again. Thank you."
155959,"We tried this on our steak the other night and really enjoyed it.  The rosemary added a nice woodsy flavor, and I liked that there wasn't a sweet ingredient - I tend to like my steaks salty, not sweet.  I think I would cut a little worcestershire out next time, as well as add a little kosher salt.  Thanks for sharing this great, easy marinade - we will definitely be using it again!"
155959,We tried this the other night.  The flavor was great.  I marinated it for about 6 hours - next time I think I'll marinate longer to really let the flavors into the meat.
155959,I can't believe I haven't rated this yet.  It is one of our go to recipes on our camping trips.  I freeze the meat with the marinade and thaw it in the cooler.  Love it!!!  Thanks for sharing!!
155959,Very good.  We will have this again!
155959,holy delicious! i didnt have rosemary so i substituted Thyme. honestly my fave marinade so far! thank you!
155959,This was a tasty little marinade.  Thanks for posting.
155959,"We liked this. I used lots of thyme, added a few red pepper flakes. Cut beef up small and made into kebabs. Next time i would marinate it longer--I only had about an hour before dinner. Tasty."
155959,"This is just simply delicious! I have been making this for about a year now and just felt compelled to compliment the chef. I have 3 extremely picky sons, and this is one of the very few things that they will all eat. It all started when the local market had london broil ""BOGO"". I found this recipe, and the rest is history. Thanks for dozens of delicious meals!"
155959,"AMAZING! I followed the recipe exactly, marinated it over night, and watched everyone lick their plates. I will making this for the rest of my life! Thanks a ton!"
155959,This was fantastic! I let it marinate for 24 hours and then used my oven broiler. My hubby and his brother devoured it! We will try this again soon with our charcoal grill.
155959,Excellent!
155959,Incredible marinade! This is exactly what I was looking for in a marinade. I've made it twice for my wife and I and both times it was excellent. Just enough zip and zing and now my mouth is watering like crazy again haha! Thank you for posting!
155959,"This is the only London Broil that I have really liked.  The marinade is just excellent.  I marinated for 24 hours.  I would suggest cooking 5 to 5 1/2 minutes per side.  I did 6 minutes per side and that made it medium, I prefer medium rare.  I sliced up the left over super thin and used for steak sandwiches."
155959,The was wonderful. Made it for my siser yesterday. She said it was delicious. She wanted to know where I got the recipe. I liked the recipe because I had all the ingredients on hand and didn't have to substitute anything. I marinated it for 22 hours then put it on the grill. The marinade made my kitchen and refridgerator smell yummy. This is really a terrific marinade. I plan on trying it on other meats. Thanks for posting.
155959,"I did not have rosemary.  I put some Mrs. Dash, Cumin and chopped Fresh Cilantro.  I cooked it in my smoker using Pecan wood and cooked it at 275 degrees until the internal temp was 132 degrees basting it when it hit 100 degrees.  I then let it rest for 15 min wrapped it in foil and cooled it down in the ref.  Sliced it thin....My wife loved it and so did.  This is a great simple marinade."
155959,"I made this yesterday and marinated it for 9 hours and it was wonderful! The only thing I changed was to use 1/4 cup of worchershire sauce instead of soy sauce and added McCormicks Montreal Steak Seasoning. We cooked it on the charcoal grill and it was the most tender london broil we've ever had. The flavor was unbelieveable delicious, and I will be using this recipe from now on for beef marinade!"
155959,It was good flavor - but strong.
155959,Delicious! Only change I made was to reverse the measurements of the Worcestershire and soy sauce. Just a matter of personal preference. Marinaded the beef for about 6 hours. Then cooked on the gas grill. Very flavorful and it really does smell yummy.
155959,Tryed it was 5 Stare/***** Good choice for cheap cut of beef.:) THANKS Ken!
155959,"I marinated this overnight, turning occasionally as suggested.  It gave a wonderful Asian flavor to the beef.  Thanks."
155959,"Delicious marinade, I made this for a family dinner and it was gobbled up!  My only comment is to make certain you slice the meat against the grain and slice it very thin.  I know this is pretty basic advice, but my husband cut ours too thick and it was a bit tough.  Great recipe!"
155959,"Love this. I used a 2.2 lb london broil, marinated 2 hours (perfect), and cooked on the BBQ. when the BBQ hit 500 deg. I put on the meat,  for 7 minutes on both sides.  Awesome.  ty again"
155959,"Fabulous marinade.  Grilled it to  perfection, and even great leftover."
155959,"I really don't know how many times I have made this and forgotten to review it! I love the flavor, and I usually have the ingredients on hand. A keeper!"
155959,This marinade gave a great taste to the steak.  The steaks were tender.  Very yummy.  Thanks KJK :)  Made for I recommend tag game
155959,"I loved the flavor of this marinade, it really does get down into the meat. My only complaint is that my London Broil was TOUGH!!!! I followed the marinade recipe, took the meat out for 30 mins before broiling it for 5 mins on each side. It looked so pretty coming out of the oven  but  I just had a feeling that it wasn't tender. Sure enough, when I cut it - tough! I even cut it from every side/angle but it didn't get any better. Despite my disappointment, my husband ""chewed thru it"" and ate every bite on his plate. Anybody have any suggestions for next time?"
155959,Simplly the BEST!!   A new family favorite!!! The flavor is fantastic & leftovers taste great (that is if you have any left overs)!!!
155959,"I tried this recipe as written and reversing the quantities of the soy sauce and worcestershire sauce, because I thought it sounded odd to have it the way it was written.  But surprisingly enough we all LOVED it as is, and although the reversed way worked, just wasn't as overwhelmingly yummy.  So, recipe is tested and approved as is!  Thanks for sharing... a new family favorite for us!"
155959,"I wanted to make this so bad until I looked at the nutritional values. I was shocked to see the fat, cholesterol and sodium for this dish. For this reason I can only give it 1 star.   I am sure the taste is 5 stars but health wins out over taste."
155959,"Grilled this tonight after marinating about 6 hours.  So full of flavor and rich tasting.  This is a keeper!  My steak was 3.5 pounds, so I increased all amounts slightly.  I agree with the others, do change the worcestershire sauce 1/4 cup and the soy sauce to 2 tbsps.  Delicious!!"
155959,This was delicious!  We grilled our first london broil this past weekend and used this marinade.  It will be a regular around here from now on.  Thank you KJK #5 and &quot;Ant&quot; Kelly.
155959,"Excellent flavor! I also reversed the amounts for soy and worcestershire sauces. Marinaded for 24 hours and broiled in the oven, 10 min. each side for medium-well done. My london broil wasn&#039;t the best cut, but we still enjoyed it because of this great flavor!"
155959,delicious! we typically grill it over high heat for 6 min per side...perfect medium rare.
155959,This is my &quot;go to&quot; recipe for whenever I find London broil on sale.  The only thing I do differently is to use low-sodium soy sauce.  Perfect every time.
155959,I followed directions exactly. I marinated for 8 hours. I used my George Forman grill and grilled each side for 5 min. and it came out perfect. I cut it as thin as I could but it still was a little tough but edible. It tasted good also. Made for Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup.
155959,Awesome marinade!  Followed the recipe to the letter.  Marinated the steak overnight.  It was delicious!  Definitely a keeper.
155959,Great marinade and my favorite part was that I had everything already in my cupboard to make it!
155959,My family loves this recipe. The meat is tender and the flavor of the marinade is not overpowering. We love it cooked on the grille.  Thanks for posting.
155959,"I&#039;m used to seeing people change nearly everything about a recipe, then saying they didn&#039;t like it. But giving a recipe one star based solely on it&#039;s nutritional values? Just plain silly."
155959,"I doubled the recipe and used low sodium gluten free soy sauce, otherwise it was by the book. I grilled two 3lb. London broils after they marinated over night and they we very tasty and everybody loved the flavor! Will certainly do this again next time we grill LB"
155959,"This was very good, the meat was more tender than usual and really flavorful. I&#039;m back to clip it, it&#039;s a keeper! Thanks Ant Kelly!"
155959,Possibly the best London Broil marinade I've found.
155959,Easy marinade but the five stars are for how our London broil tasted.
155959,"Made my very first London broil with this recipe and it was amazing. Warm the night of it was great, but the next day, as sandwich meat or with cheese and crackers cold... I think it was even better!!!! I had a somewhat larger cut so it took more like 8 minutes on each side with the broiler and the rack on the third rung from the top. I also have a meat tenderizer that I used thoroughly on both sides. Came out medium rare in the direct middle and a little more towards medium at the sides, and not at all tough. So delish I am making it again this week. But marinating it for 4 hours instead of 2 and am contemplating using the slow cooker crock pot. Haven't decided if I want to change anything yet."
155959,I too don't like it when people change a recipe without trying it first as written. This London Broil is excellent as is. My daughter just moved out on her own and being away at school for 4 years with having everything made didn't want to fall into the take out food trap. So this is the recipe I helped her make. She loved how easy and tasty it is. She said she will be making it again. Thank you for a great marinade.
155959,"Wow, what a fantastic marinade! I marinated this for 24 hours, did not change any of the ingredients. My cuts of meat were a little thick, so it took longer than the 5-5 1/2 minutes another reviewer said to broil each side for to achieve medium rare. I'd go with ~7 minutes in the future. What the directions don't tell you (us first-timers) to look for on your finished piece of meat is for the outside to have a nice dark brown/char on it if you are cooking in an oven. It should certainly look like the pictures people have posted when done. This turned out nice and tender. The diamond cuts are more like an &quot;X&quot; pattern on both sides of the meat. My boyfriend and I loved this!! It's definitely going to be made again. Thanks"
155959,This was just OK. I found the worchestershire sauce to be too pronounced. I used fresh rosemary and could not detect it in the final product. I would probably move on to another recipe.
155959,"Like many others I love the marinade and the flavor of the beef. I used flank steak. Probably could have cooked it a few minutes longer, but I can't say enough about it. Like another reviewer I cut up and heated a briefly in the microwave to toss in a romaine and kale mix salad. Used poppyseed dressing and there in some pumpkin seeds, or chopped almonds. A few dried cherries or cranberries was especially tasty. This will be a standard favorite for me."
155959,"I used this marinade for London broil. It was delicious, ingredients are ones you typically have on hand, and it only has to marinate for several hours."
155959,I'm trying this tonight. My London broil is marinating as we speak. I had all of the ingredients on hand and together it smells so good. I'll lyk how it turns out.
155959,Question?can. this be cooked in the oven or croc pot?
155959,Recipe was great. only thing I changed was time needed. Needed almost 12 mins per side to be med rare. Still delicious. Just wish I had timed accordingly.
155959,Excellent marinade for those bargain London Broils on sale this time of year.
155959,"This marinade is great. After marinating the beef for about 4 hours I browned both sides being careful to not burn the balsamic on the outside of the beef. I then cooked it in a pressure cooker for an hour with 18 oz. of Brown Ale, a sprig of rosemary, package of onion soup mix, and 2 tbs. of condensed beef bullion. Once done I thinly sliced the beef and put it on some country french bread being sure to get plenty of juices then topped with carmelized onions and shreded mozerella chesse. Placed that under the broiler until the cheese melted and topped with some creamy horseradish sauce. Best hot dip roast beef sandwich I have ever had."
155959,This is now my favorite marinate. My husband loved the London broil
155959,"Absolutely devine!! My father called me a few weeks ago and asked &quot;how the hell am I supposed to cook this british steak you brought me?&quot; I smiled, took a sip of my adult libations, and replied, &quot;should I cook you dinner tonight?&quot; I admittedly 'winged' the marinade, using a plethora of random condiments containing vinegar that i could find in the fridge. It was okay- it's steak! He suggested (in the flat-out dad type manner) that I cook it again for dinner. I figured his tastebuds, so damaged from 30+ years in a trona mine, wouldn't know the difference if I used an actual marinade recipe. fast-forward to dinner time. Margaritas, daquiris, and dinner on the deck. Glorious potatoes, gorgeous beef, and anxious old me- just certian he'll have some dad-like critique to feed me. &quot;This isn't the same as last time,&quot; he says, Pausing beefly to lick the leftovers from his moustache. &quot;No, it's not...&quot; before I could add that I'd tried something else, he smiles a wry little twisted grin, and says, &quot;this is even better. New favorite.&quot; Instantly inserted in the recipe book! (; thanks Kelly, from pops and I both!"
155959,"I agree with many cooks that you review the recipe the way the user posted it. If you have a different way, post your version under your own thread. I want to read reviews of the recipe as written..... that being my soapbox moment, ant's London broil is delish! I made the marinade as written.... I'm not a rosemary fan but this is great. I marinated overnight in zip lock bags..there were 2 steaks..... 5 mins a side.... I was worried the marinade might burn but there again... perfection.... you get this wonderful crust and if course the time depends on thickness of your steaks... I tend more towards rare and this was wonderful. The flavors are spot on. Cold leftovers made great steak sandwiches. Great recipe just the way it is!!!!!"
155959,Best London broil ever. So simple and delicious. I grow rosemary in my herb garden which really tastes so good fresh picked.
155959,"Finally found a recipe that made me like London Broil! After numerous prior attempts, resulting in tasteless tough meats this time we loved it. Was ready to never try again, till now. Marinated for 24 hrs and then reverse seared it on Primo ceramic grill. Will increase garlic next time, otherwise fantastic!"
155959,"I am being sarcastic here as I also believe if one changes a recipe they should refrain from rating the original recipie. My Sarcasm: Great recipe. I did make a few changes for the better! My entire family is VEGAN, so I substituted as follows: Eggplant for the meat. Malt vinegar for the balsamic. No fat organic sour cream for the olive oil. Habanero sauce for the worstershire. Nutmeg for rosemary. I cooked all in my pressure cooker for 30 minutes on high. We all loved it!! It's just that we thought it was kind of mushy, too spicy. None of my dogs would go near it?? THIS IS MY NEW GO TO MEAL! IF I ever make it again."
155959,Delicious! Would have given 5 stars but I think it should be marinated longer than the recipe suggests.
155959,Tried this recipe tonight and it turned out well. I normally cook chunks of meat in a crock pot until they fall apart but wanted to try a prepare more like a steak. I followed the recipe and it was very good. My adult son who does not like any steak like type of meat tried and he liked it also. I will use the recipe again but will try with Tamari sauce instead of soy since my sons GF cannot eat gluten. I cooked a bit to long for my desire temp but it was at 120 and a minute or so later it was at 145 so next time I will try to take off before this. We prefer rare. Thanks
155959,"Terrific marinade!!! I use it with my sous vide setup at 138F for about 8 hours, then sear each side for about a minute in a cast iron skillet. I do add some brown sugar to assist in forming a good crust, but otherwise this is perfect! And the sous vide makes it soooooo tender. This is my go-to Sunday dinner entree!"
155959,"I've made this several times, and it never disappoints! I've marinated as little as 2-3 hours and as much as 24, and it's delicious every time. My grill is broken, so I make it on a grill pan on the stove top, 6 min per side on medium-high. Thank you for this amazing marinade!!"
155959,My entire life I had refused to eat london broil due to it being a sub par cut of meat...that was until my wife tried this marinate. We have it bi weekly now. Thank you!!!
155959,"I had been missing the great London Broils I enjoyed at the home of my friends and neighbors the Picards in Mohegan Lake, NY before I moved to Maryland ten years ago. I finally decided to try it myself. This recioe is THE BOMB. Awesome! Easy to do and perfect results. I appreciate the tip on cooking time. Thank you so much."
155959,I tried this recipe as written last week and it was a HIT. My family loves it. The only change was I placed the roast on my George Forman Grill for about 8 minutes. Let it rest for 10 minutes and it was perfect. This recipe is a keeper!
155959,This looks awesome! Just put the London broil in the marinade. Looking forward to eating it tonight!
155959,I followed the directions step by step and it turned out perfect.
22123,"Well, I certainly DID feel like cooking last night, and this recipe was just what I was looking for!  I made my own mushroom sauce since I didn't want to add any dairy to the meal.  I also made up a cornbread mix because that stuff isn't available in my corner of the world.  I was totally stressed out yesterday, need to do some cooking, and also needed some kind of comfort food for the family.  Even my picky eaters had a helping!  I upped the quantities to feed 6, and my only complaint is that there wasn't enough left over to bring in for lunch today.  Diamonds4heather, this really fit the bill, thanks so much for posting this recipe!"
22123,"Another success story.  This is fabulous recipe that is fast and delicious.  The husband and kids loved this one too!  The cornbread is a big hit with the kids, it's crunchy and kinda of sweet, a perfect combination.  Thank you diamonds4heather for another wonderful receipe."
22123,"Mercy, what a top notch mixture of tastes and textures.  I found this very filling and not too much work.  I came home last night dead on my feet but that doesn't stop the little monsters from screaming for dinner.  This slipped into the oven rapidly and everyone was pleased.  I think I will make this for the ladies bridge group meeting at my house next month.  Thanks for posting this winner!"
22123,"This was great!!  I put it all together when I got home from work in no time.  There were no leftovers to have today.  I used peas when I made this, next time I'll try broccoli.  This really reminded me of a potpie.  So simple to make and quick."
22123,"This is just so quick and easy to make! It's a great mixture of flavors. My husband declared ""we'll make this one a regular""! I used ground turkey and frozen mixed vegetables. Added a spinach salad and dinner was done! Thanks, Heather, this is one that will get a lot of use!!"
22123,I don't know how I felt about this casserole.  We ended up throwing a lot of it out.  I made my own cornbread and used a different cream soup because nobody in my house likes mushrooms . . . I don't know there was something off about the taste for us but to each their own.  Sorry.
44895,"Truly delicious!  It is surprising that you can get such a wonderful brownie by doctoring a brownie mix.  I substituted 1/3 c buttermilk for the water and 1/2 cup melted butter for the oil.  I also added 1 t. of vanilla and used a Pillsbury fudge brownie mix instead of Betty Crocker. My brownies were done after cooking for 35 minutes.  I do not really like brownies that much...just made these for a book club meeting, but these are outstanding!"
44895,"Wow.  These brownies were absolutely delicious.  I used the Symphony Bar with toffee chips and almonds which added great flavor.  This recipe is on the ""must make again"" list.  Thanks."
44895,OMG!  I love you!  They were fantastic.  I'll definitely be making these again...soon!  Thanks for sharing. :o)
44895,I'm so glad you posted this recipe...I have been making these whenever I need to bring something to a party. I use the Symphony bar with almonds and toffee. (I just warn the peanut allergy guests) Everybody thinks this I made them from scratch. They are SO Good!
44895,"The first time I tasted these I thought that they were from scratch.  You can use any brownie mix because the symphony bars are what do the trick.  I have a homemade brownie we like, but these are so quick and soooo good!  Thanks for posting."
44895,"Yum, yum, yum! This was the star of our Super Bowl menu! So easy and so delicious. I also used the Symphony with the toffee and almond bits, and it's wonderful served warm. Thanks!"
44895,"My BF said that these were the best brownies he had ever tasted!  I used a 5 ounce Symphony bar I got on sale for .33 and some  minature Heath bars.  Also, I topped off with 1/4 of a can of left over frosting chocolate frosting.  I got my Betty Crocker mix on sale for .88.  This was simple to make and decadent tasting.  Also, these brownies only cost me around $2-3 to make!!  I will definitely be making these again."
44895,"I had to make a dessert to bring to our annual company picnic.  This recipe looked easy and fast, and based on the reviews, sounded delicious.  It was all that, and more!  I used a box of Pillsbury (family size 13 x 9) brownie mix since I wanted to get as many brownies as I possibly could.  I used about 2 1/2 5 ounce Symphony Bars since I couldn't find the 7 ounce ones.  Mine also had the toffee chips as well. I baked for about 30 minutes, but I actually should have taken them out around 25-27.  Topped them with a can of whipped chocolate milk frosting and they were gone before you knew it!  Thanks Judikins for an easy, delicious, and time saving recipe I will make again!"
44895,"I just made these earlier this evening.  I used duncan hines chewy brownie mix and 3 symphony bars.  Also, I used a 13x9 inch pan  and baked for 30 minutes.  I put foil in the bottom of the pan and lightly greased.  Omg!  these are so delicious.  I saw Paula Deen make these and had to try them.  This is definitely a keeper!  To my suprise my DH really liked these too.  I will be making these again."
44895,A friend made these for our monthly quilt meeting.  These are the best!  I can't wait to make them myself.  fitquilter
44895,I made these in mini muffin tins and cut the time to about 20 min. using one square of candy 'muffin'. Delicious! Gotta love Paula Deen. I'll make these over and over!
44895,After a friend gave me this recipe I had to check and be sure that it was posted some where as it was so good! The only changes to the recipe that I made were I used 3 of the seven oz bars and I used a ghirardelli brownie mix with walnuts in an 11x13 pan.  It doesn't look like enough batter but it bake up perfectly!  They were the first dish gone at this yr's Holiday gathering!
44895,"A friend of mine first introduced me to these, they are heavenly!"
44895,"Can't say enough superlatives for this recipe.  I've probably overlooked this suggestion, but if not -- Symphony Toffee and Almond bars make a ""hard to believe"" grand slam in the bottom of the 9th impact on this simple recipe.  One suggestion -- they are so rich than be cut in half the normal size of brownies and still be dazzling."
44895,Family member brought these to me today...OMG! I am pregnant and tore them up. SO moist and delicious!!
44895,I made this recipe using a dark chocolate brownie mix and also added in one can of cherry pie filling on topy of the candy bars before adding the final brownie layer. Dark chocolate brownies with milk chocolate and cherry filling. Yum! Thanks for posting!
44895,This is hands down my husbands favorite brownies in the whole world. It's so crazy rich that only a tiny bite is all you need to be satisfied!
44895,These should be illegal they are so good!!  I used 2 1/2 symphony bars with toffee and almond pieces and used a Betty Crocker supreme brownie mix with hershey's syrup.  Crazy delicious!!!
44895,"This brownie is always a big hit and is easy to make.  I use two Duncan Hines Turtle Brownie mixes with the caramel packet.  I mix the first batch (according to the fudgy brownie option), put it in the pan, then place 4 ""license-plate"" (the largest available) size Symphony bars with toffee and almonds side to side across the 9 x 13"" pan, filling in any cracks.  Then, cover with the second brownie mix, squiggle the caramel over the top and pull a serated knife down lengthwise to make a fun pattern.  Be careful not to overbake. Will need to cool completely before cutting into small squares with sharp knife. Enjoy!"
44895,"I love these brownies as well, but the last two times i have made them my candy bars are not even melting, Please advise."
107229,"These were great!!!! I made this recipe for PAC spring 2007. I brought some to work, I told my mom to come by and pick some up for dinner, she did and her company loved them. I didn't have cilantro at the time but I really like it and will make sure to use it nex time, This dish is great Hot or Cold. Thanks Reed!!!  Barbara"
39947,These are really good and look awesome on the table! Great Recipe! I used three different color grapes and all three shades were beautiful with the sugar glaze! I also sugared a bunch and attatched it to a candle stick holder and tied a ribbon around it... it looked great as a center piece!
39947,Made these gorgeous grapes to place next to Mizz Nezz's Very Chocolate Cheesecake. They made for a beautiful presentation and tasted wonderful! My sister couldn't stop eating them and neither could I. Thanks for posting... these will be adorning many of my desserts in the future.
39947,An interesting concept enjoyed by our guest. A whole bunch disapeared somewhat rapidly. I will also try alternative coatings such as sour cream as well as different sugars. 
453467,"Originally I was gonna cut the recipe in half (just the 2 of us here), but then we had a park-wide yard sale, & I made the whole batch & used them as enticements for potential buyers ~ what the hey, a free cookie as delicious as these are, definitely works its magic! Will be making these again, for sure! Thanks for posting the recipe!"
149593,"This is one of the most creative canvass board recipes I've used.  The first time I made this I used sweetened coconut and 1/3 cup dried cranberies, as well as more coconut as a topping, plus applesauce to make it more sweet.  The second time I kept the applesauce and the cocunut, but added cinnamon, a pinch of nutmeg and chopped apples (granny smith).  Both worked beautifully, and I will definetely use this recipe again and again."
149593,"These are wonderful moist muffins and would be good with about anything added to them!!!  I decided to add some mini chocolate chips and some almond extract and they were sooooo good!!  Thanks Kit!!  Can't wait to bake them again with cranberries or coconut or blueberries, etc., etc.!!!"
149593,"A very handy muffin recipe to have!  I ran out of sour cream and topped off the cup with buttermilk, which worked just fine.  I added chocolate chips and topped with some sugar.  Very moist and tasty.  Thanks for posting!"
149593,"As always, your recipes never fail!  It's like when I see a recipe tagged with your name I know I can't go wrong!  Guys, these muffins are fabulous!  Moist and fluffy!  I used almond extract and mini chocolate chips like Redsie did, and they came out awesome!  I thought I'd try putting in orange zest next time with the same combo, but the add ins could be just anything your heart desires! Thanks Kitten for yet another winner!"
149593,"I wanted to try these because they are almost identical to another Zaar recipe that I use all the time, except these have more sugar. I wanted to see if the additional sugar made a lot of difference. I was surprised that it did. The tops of these muffins were crisper and the muffins were chewier and not as tender. They were good muffins but I do prefer the less sugar version. I used almond extract and added in 1 cup of dried cherries and 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips. An excellent and tasty combination! Another good combo is chocolate chips, dried cranberries and some orange zest. The possibilities are indeed endless. :) Thanks Kitten!"
149593,I made these this week and they were soo good! I added pecans on mine.
149593,"MMM....Yummy muffins....I had put in some nutmeg and about 1 1/2 cups of blueberry infused Craisins. This recipe is fantastic Kitten as is all your other recipes. They are very tasty with my morning tea. Always love your recipes Kitten, thanks for sharing."
70971,This pie was fantastic!!  Tasted just like a banana split!  YUMMMMMMM!!  I will be making this quite often especially in the summer.  Thank you Julia06 ; )
70971,Big hit with the family! I crushed the oreo cookies and mixed in a little melted butter to hold it together. I also added chopped walnuts on top! It was great!
24701,I don't think there was enough flavor in this soup. I sprinkled it with soy parmesan cheese and that really helped. I will try it again with a stronger vegetarian broth and maybe would not blend it next time because it is not appealling looking when it is blended.
24701,This is an easy & healthy recipe but doesn't really have a lot of flavor.  I might try it again but would have to add a few additions to perk it up.  I've had similar style soups that I loved so I'm a bit disappointed with the way this turned out.
63986,I made this for dinner tonight and the chops were tasty and fork tender! If you are salt sensitive (I am not) I would cut back on the salt and look for low sodium soup. I couldn't resist adding a half cup of white wine and thicken the juices. This was excellent served with rice and chive buttered fresh carrots. For a simple meal that is hardy this is just the ticket!
63986,"A big hit with the meat-and-potatoes guy in the house.  Served the chops with mashed potatoes.  Be sure you don't overcook the chops if yours aren't 1"" thick.  Thanks, Chuck."
63986,Wow....great crockpot recipe!!  The chops were very tasty and so tender!  Many thanks!
63986,"This was excellent. I bought chops that were just over an inch thick and let them cook for a solid 8 hours. The sauce made from the meat and soup was delicious served over couscous. I served this with Roosie's Zucotte (#96811) and we had a great meal.  The meat fell right off the bones, it was so tender and juicy. Everyone here enjoyed this dish very much - thank you for sharing!"
63986,"I didn't realize that this was a crock pot recipe until I was getting started on planning dinner only a couple of hours to go so I made it in a fry pan- reduced the recipe to 1 chop, used the whole tin of soup, 1 1/2 tsp mustard and the full garlic. Browned the chop, poured in the soup mixture and cooked it at 2 element level for the full 2 hours. Perfect and the aroma in the house was wonderfull. I added some broccoli & peppers last 10 minutes, served with steamed carrots Wonderful dinner thanks Chuck"
63986,The pork chops were very tender and tasty.  I was very impressed at how good they tasted.  I will be making these again.  Thanks Chuck.
63986,"A new family favorite - thanks - this is soooo easy.  I also missed that it was crockpot, but with the advance browning, had enough time to cook on high for 3 hours- turned out great!"
63986,"This was really good.  I used 3 boneless porkchops and cooked the whole thing in a covered electric skillet for 1 hour, and the meat was tender.  Served it with brown rice, and the gravy over the rice was just like what my grandmother cooked! Yumm!"
63986,"Yummy pork chops.  Even the fussy husband enjoyed them.  I used reduced salt soup and served it over rice.  Easy, quick and tasty....how can you go wrong. "
63986,I have made this recipe for many years. My family loves it.
63986,"I used 4 boneless chops and the full measure of soup and seasonings. I stirred in a package of Express Rice (the kind that microwaves in 90 seconds) for the last 30 minutes of cooking. Delicious, and the leftovers were even better! Made for Alphabet Soup Game."
63986,"Very good!  This is so similar to one of my favorite chicken recipes (Recipe #204668) that I can't believe I didnt' think to try it with pork chops myself.  I served this with wild rice and steamed veggies.  I just eyeballed the seasoning amounts, so I'm sure I used more than called for on some.  Thank you for posting... it was delicious!"
63986,Excellent! A friend gave me this recipe years ago.  One of my favorites.
63986,"We just ate these for dinner this evening,with spicy roasted green beans and cheesy corn muffins..I made 4 chops otherwise followed the recipe...When the chops were fork tender, I added 1/3 cup chicken broth and 1/3 cup long grain raw rice.And fresh ground black pepper over the chops...The flavor was wonderful and the chops were so tender..My DH said to make more rice next time so I will use 1 cup of broth and rice next time..I will be making this often.Thank U for this great recipe.."
63986,"I used 6 boneless chops on the high setting for 3.5 hours.  The family loved it.  Truly an easy, tasty, ""set-it-and-forget-it"" recipe.  Thanks, Chuck!"
63986,"as a young married woman i made back in 1970, i made this recipe for the two of us..now we are empty nesters, still working lotsa hours and it is STILL great!!!"
63986,Love this recipe... easy and the pork chops fall apart!! Added sliced carrots to the bottom of the crock pot and served over mashed potatoes.  I  also added more dry mustard and ground pepper to the flour mixture.
63986,"THANK YOU!! This recipe is to die for! MANY years ago I came across this recipe (for my crockpot) and prepared it frequently as it was such a hit. A thousand moves later & with recipes lost, I've been searching for this exact recipe!! It's on the menu tonight & I can hardly wait!!"
63986,"One of the best old crockpot recipes! I always layer the browned/floured and seasoned chops with thinly sliced potatoes and onions. Also, you can substitute the soup with any kind of chicken broth and a little leftover cooked rice can be thrown in if you have it. This is delicious on a cold wintry day."
67888,"Ribs are a favorite of mine and this looked so good with the two sauces.  This is an excellent rib recipe and the sauces are awesome!  It does take awhile to make the sauces and measure everything out, but the end result is so worth it!  If you like ribs and want something different to make try these!  They are sure to please your taste buds!"
25775,"The recipe was good but too salty.  I agree with Gretchen, either cut it in half or omit all together."
25775,"It was alright, but won't be rushing out to make it again, family didn't like the texture. Maybe if I tinker with it a bit."
25775,"I dont know Sueies familys problem but mine all have loved it  for years!!! Even got my inlaws and friends making it for their get togethers , often served,  Bonnie"
25775,"Great way to make spinach that doesn't taste too much like spinach.  I needed to make it non dairy, so I had to use ""cream"" of mushroom soup and skip the cheese, so it was not as creamy as it should have been.  However, the non-spinach fans ate it and the spinach fans thought it was great. "
25775,"I made it for guests.  They raved about it.  I used fresh spinach from my garden, half fat mushroom soup and low fat mozzarella cheese and it turned out very good.  Added a bit more spices for a zestier version.  A great way to have spinach!"
25775,"I had to come up with something FAST for a potluck.  This was great! Everyone loved it and polished off a double batch.  A touch too salty, between the salt, cheese and canned soup.  I would cut the salt at least in half, or omit it altogether.  Quick, easy and nutritious!"
25775,"Take it from the other reviewers, omit the salt altogether because it is way too salty with it.  I also added some chopped mushrooms from a can and it was a hit!"
25775,"It thrilled me to see this recipe on your site. I used it 25 yrs. ago and lost it during my move. This is a delicious recipe! It was ironic, I took this to a festive gathering when I was in cosmetology school and recently I run into one of the classmates at a business, and he remembered me for this Spinach recipe, after 25 yrs! He said he NEVER eat spinach till he ate this. Thank you for renewing my memory on the GRAND SPINACH CASSEROLE!"
25775,"My family doesn't like spinach, but this was gone in a day.  I used a stronger cheese and it worked great."
25775,"Okay.... maybe I made this wrong, but I ended up with mushy spinach with hard crusty crouton on top. The texture left lots to be desired and the taste was mediocre.  Were the croutons supposed to absorb some of the juices?  I will not be trying this one again... and I normally love spinach."
25775,"I tried this out because I had a couple of cans of spinach in the cabinet. I squeezed them out REAL well. I had a ""ball o'spinach"" after I squeezed all the liquid out. I didn't have croutons so I crushed up about half a package of Ritz crackers, added 2 Tbsp of melted butter, tossed, and topped the casserole with this.WOW was this good! It even reheated well. I did use more spinach than called for (at 14 ounces per can instead of 10 ounces for frozen) and it was a bit ""spinachy"", so might add more cheese and maybe some cooked ground turkey or sausage next time. But both the DH and I loved it and we normally don't eat cooked spinach - THANK YOU!!!!"
25775,This was the best my husband and I ate it up in 12 hrs.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe.
25775,It was pretty good.  I used Durkee Onions on top instead of croutons and they made it ready yummy.  I will make it again.
25775,What a hit last night!!! Everyone  raved about the flavor and asked for seconds. I did however use cream of celery soup because I'm not a mushroom fan. Thank-you for a delicious recipe.
25775,OK. This worked. Great pasta that my children enjoyed.  Any healthy recipe I can get them to eat deserves 5 solid stars!
25775,Very good.  Be sure to squeeze the juice out of the frozen spinach so the casserole isn't runny.
25775,Very cheesy.  I love spinach so I'm willing to try almost anything with it in it.   
25775,"Karen this is the way I will fix my spinach from now on. Loved it!! I like spinach anyway, but is the BEST! I had to make a couple of substitutions: 1. I was out of cream of mushroom so used cream of celery and 2. out of croutons and used Frenches cheddar french fried onions in the can. I like it fixed this way so well, thats the way I'll keep on fixing it. This is definately a keeper. Oh, and the sharp cheddar is great, I would definately not use a mild cheese in this dish. Very easy to prepare also. Thanks for posting this recipe."
25775,"awesome recipe, i have always liked spinach, but could never get my family to eat it. They gobbled this up, but i would have liked to have eaten this all by myself, like what usually happens with spinach. It was so easy to make and i had everything on hand. I also added some chopped mushrooms. Fantastic recipe, i would give it 10 stars.."
25775,"My whole family loved this casserole. I had to make a few changes. I did not have cream of mushroom soup so I used cream of chicken. I also did not have any croutons so I followed the advice from another reveiw and used half a pack of ritz and 2 tbls. of melted butter. I was planning on using sharp cheddar cheese but at the last min had to use monterey jack. Even with the changes we loved this recipe, next time I make it I think I will try it out as the recipe is written and see which we like best. Thanks so much."
25775,Sorry.  My family didn't care for this at all.
25775,"We really enjoyed this recipe.  I was craving spinach, but getting so bored with the usual ways we cook it. I used some Colby/Jack cheese, doubled the recipe.  I didn't have any croutons or crackers, so I just topped off with bread crumbs mixed with a little Parmesan.  Next time though, I will cut down on the onion just a bit."
25775,"This casserole turned out awesome! I used french fried onions instead of croutons, next time I might eliminate the salt though. Thanks for this recipe!"
25775,Good but I don't think I made it right.  I have to tweak it.
25775,Very good!
25775,We thought this was just ok.  Thanks for posting.
25775,"We are already spinach lovers so this was exceptionally good to us. I used buttered breadcrumbs and cream of celery soup. Reheats up pretty well, too."
25775,It was a great recipe.  I needed a fast side dish to go with beer can chicken and roasted potatoes and I had all the ingredients on hand.
25775,Made a great side-dish for some pork spare ribs. I used cream of chicken soup and ommitted the salt.
25775,this food is heaven.  i loved it.
25775,"I used cream of chicken soup, ommited salt and used french dried onion last five minutes only because I was out of crutons.The  next night I used it as a dip with triscuts for a late night snack. Yummy!!"
25775,"Excellent spinach recipe; however, too much salt for us. Next time, I will not add the salt.  Otherwise, it was very good and we will indeed repeat this recipe."
25775,Delicious but I will cut out the salt next time.
25775,"Fantastic!! I followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT I added 1/2 a cup of brown rice and 1 cup of water to the final mix and put it in the oven....delicious, it was a bit like a spinach risotto! I didn't use the croutons due to a wheat intolerance. This dish was delicious, thank you!"
25775,"Very good! Used NO salt and topped with a 2.8 oz can of french fried onions instead of croutons and a packet of Lipton onion soup mix , instead of the chopped onion, still was a little salty, will use reduced salt soup next time, but still a very, very good recipe.Don't forget to drain the water out of the spinach or it will be soupy."
25775,"Delicious! I'm trying to find new ways to incorporate spinach into my diet, and this did the trick! However, as others have said, I would also omit the salt next time, as it was very salty!"
25775,"This recipe was good. I teach a cooking class at a nutrition program in Harlem and we used ingredients that we had on hand so we changed the recipe slightly. We used 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup and instead of croutons we used crumbled low sodium saltine crackers with some added salt and pepper and dried parsley. We also left out the salt from the recipe. When I make this again I would saute the onions first, the onion flavor was a little too strong for me. Thanks for a quick healthy recipe!"
25775,Our company and ourselves really liked this recipe it was a good way to make spinach. I used 2% sharp cheddar to make it less fattening and I didn't have any croutons so I used Italian style bread crumbs.
25775,"I made this using 1 x bunch of fresh spinach and 1 x box of frozen spinach; also used condensed cream of chicken soup.   It was absolutely delicious, with the whole family declaring it a hit.    I didn't cook it quite long enough and it was lukewarm in the middle, but still lovely.   I would reduce the salt next time to a pinch as the soup is fairly salty in itselfA definate keeper and thanks for sharing such a quick and easy recipe"
25775,"I followed this recipe rather loosely in the sense that I didn't measure anything. I used colby-jack cheese, and I didn't have any croutons, so I sprinkled with breadcrumbs instead. It turned out really wonderful. I was surprised since I don't LOVE spinach. WHen I make this again I will probably brown the onions in a skillet before I put them into the casserole, just so they are softer. I didn't mind that the onions were crunchy, but my daughter was a little sickened by the crunchiness of the onions."
25775,This was yummy! I just sprinkled a little salt in after reading the other reviews. I also went light on the onion because I'm not a huge fan (nor do I enjoy chopping it!). I think next time I make it I will try Ritz crackers instead of croutons.
25775,Delicious!
25775,"Wonderful!  I love spinach any way it's made but this dish is really tasty.  It is very easy to prepare with ingredients I always have on hand.  I did two things different I added a few red pepper flakes for a little extra zip and omited the croutons and after taking it from the oven just topped it with a little more shredded cheese. i served with crockpot pot roast, mashed potatoes with gravy. Thanks so much for sharing your delicious recipe!"
25775,"This was excellent spinach!  I omitted the croutons as well because I don't like them. Didn't miss it.  Also, make sure you chop the onion very super fine or it will be crunchy.  I think next time I might saute the onion in some butter before I add in because my onion didn't soften enough for me!  This is a great side dish!  I also use a recipe roughly like this for broccoli too and that comes out awesome too!  Thanks Karen for sharing!"
25775,very good
25775,This was great!  Next time I'll try it with broccoli.
25775,"Skipped the onion, salt, and croutons. Topped with a little bit of the cheese instead. Squeezed out the spinach VERY well. Very easy to throw together. The texture was good, but I am sorry to say that this was a flop. I thought it was edible (only edible) and my DH absolutely hated it.  I won't give a star rating because of the ingredients I skipped, but I also won't make this again."
25775,I really enjoyed this easy to put together side dish. I eliminated the salt as other reviewers had suggested and used reduced sodium cream of mushroom soup. I used one cup of croutons. Will make again.
25775,"I great, quick-to-make spinach recipe.  It was a bit too salty for me, but otherwise it tasted quite good.  I used saltines instead of croutons and it worked well for me.  Thanks for sharing."
25775,"It was fair. We ate it the first night and it was good, not as good as the main dish we had prepared (portobello mushroom sandwiches) but definitely edible. However, the leftovers went uneaten, just didn't ever appeal to me to heat them back up) Definitely not a BAD dish, but i doubt I'll make it again in the near future. Still, if I went to someone else's house and they had made it, I'd eat some!"
25775,The whole family...myself...DH and my 22 year old step son LOVED this recipe! That says ALOT since neither of 'the boys' like spinach too much!
25775,"I wasn't expecting this to be so good. Both my boys ate what was on their plates. I was told ""Mom, this is a make again"".  Thank you so much for posting this recipe."
25775,"This was really good...even to me who doesn't like spinach!  I used fresh baby spinach.  I was afraid it would be a little too dry, but it tasted great.  Try it....you'll like it!"
25775,"This was delicious. I used one small bag of fresh spinach. I did not cook the spinach first, just added it with the other ingredients. It cooked just fine in the casserole. I think the next time I make this though, I will use two bags of spinach as it was very ""saucey"". I also did not have sharp cheddar cheese so I substituted a cheddar/jack combo, which was fine."
25775,"Very yummy!  I used fresh spinach but only had 13 ounces instead of 20.  If you are short of spinach, like I was, I would omit the salt and everything else should be fine.  Thank you!"
25775,"WOW!! What a fabulous recipe. I didnt have cheddar cheese so I used monteray jack and colby cheese. I also precooked the onions,used 98% fatfree soup,garlic and cheese croutons.  DH loved it! requested artichoke  hearts next time. What a great recipe,cant wait to make again.  What a clever way to fix spinach!  Thanks Karen!! This is a keeper in my house."
25775,"Very good! I sauteed my onions, garlic, and baby portabella mushrooms in a little olive oil and white wine. I chopped up a can of artichoke hearts and used the reduced sodium condensed soup. I didn't have croutons but bread crumbs worked just fine! I also used half cheddar half pepper jack..wonderful! I will definitely be making again."
25775,"First let me say that I'm not a big fan of cooked spinach (love it raw). That being said, this was delicious, and I even had seconds. Whole family ate it up. Made as written, except I used bread crumbs on top instead of croutons because that's all I had. I think the croutons would be better, more crunch. Definitely a keeper."
25775,Really nice.  I used fresh silverbeet but it still came out well.
25775,"I thought the salt was way too much in this recipe, I would cut it down to at least 1/2 tsp. maybe even only 1/4 tsp. I think this casserole actually would make a great spinach dip with tortilla chips! That's how we ended up eating it!"
25775,Fantastic!  Very tasty.  For a twist on the second time making this recipe I crumbled bacon across the top before baking.  It gave it a bit of a crunch.  Thanks :)
25775,Had a good flavor just not enough sauce or cheese.
25775,"Absolutley delicious! When I was a kid growing up my Mom used to make Brocoli casserole, and she coined the recipe as the way she got her kids to eat brocoli. This recipe, as noted, can be made with either spinach or brocoli- and both ways are equally good. When making the spinach casserole, I added about half a block of cream cheese, and followed the rest as is. As for the brocoli casserole, you do as shown, but my Mom taught me to make the topping with 1 c. bisquick and .5 stick softened butter rather then crutons/bread crumbs. Both casseroles are a great way to eat your veggies!"
25775,"I only gave this recipe 4 stars because my husband was not a big fan. He thought it would be better served as a side dish. I thought it was pretty good, but I don't think I will be making it again."
25775,"Fast, easy and absolutely delicious. I file this under what I call ""Pantry Perfect REcipes"" as its a tasty dish made from all readily available ingredients that are almost always on hand."
25775,"God bless you and your recipe - you got my very picky toddler to eat a whole plate of spinach, and I even hid some chicken in it. THANK YOU! Couple changes - I omitted the egg and the salt. Instead of the onion, I used three small shallots that I sauteed in a little butter before adding to the mixture. Very good mild flavor. Also, I used herb-seasoned stuffing instead of the croutons but had to cover the dish with foil half-way through cooking so that the stuffing wouldn't burn. I will make this recipe many more times!!!"
25775,"I thought that this was good ,but not great. I felt that it was missing something, like sour cream maybe. Also I personally didn't care for the croutons in it."
25775,This was delicious! next time i will try it with the awesome homemade french fried onions i found on recipezaar! #44115  they are yummy! thanks for making spinach good! LOL my DH loves it and i USED to hate it!!
25775,"This was yummy but soooooo rich! We ate ours with tortilla chips. I couldn't imagine eating a whole meal of this by itself. We like it as a dip tho. This was fun to try, but I probably won't be making this for our dinner again. It's still a good recipe tho! Perhaps as a dip to put out on the holidays."
25775,"This was just ok in our opinion.  If you like spinach as we do, not a great recipe.  But if you don't like spinach, I'm sure this is a great one, because it masks the taste completely.  I'll probably be using this again when I have picky kids!!!"
25775,"This was easy, but only moderately tasty.  I used reduced sodium canned soup, and it was still very salty.  I'll omit the added salt next time."
25775,"Yessss!!!  Finally got my son to eat spinach... only took 18 years!   I used Low  fat ritz crackers, omitted the salt and added some artichoke hearts that I had leftover (sauteed in onion garlic and olive oil) really excellent... oh also had to use fresh spinach 'cuz that's what I had on hand.  Thanks for an easy fix!"
25775,I used low sodium com soup and it was graciously received by my family for Christmas dinner.  We all agree it's a keeper for us!
25775,"Excellent! I omitted the salt and used Mrs. Dash's seasoning. I also did not put croutons on the top and it was still great. Very easy to make. I do not think it serves 8-10, more like 6 servings."
25775,"Sorry, the only person that liked this was my son.  I like spinach in general but didn't like this at all.  Of the 5 people in my family that tried it only one liked it."
25775,"Didn't like this either, sorry.  Definitely too salty, and I looove salt! Only thing I did different was not add onion, cause I don't like onion.  I added extra cheese at the end, but now I'm mad I wasted precious cheese on something I couldn't even finish my portion of, and I won't be eating the leftovers of.  :(  Oh well.  Can't always believe something's going to be a winner (for you) just because of tons of positive reviews.  I've been wrong before, and I'm sure I will be again."
25775,Wow this was so yummy!
25775,Very good and very easy to make.
25775,this was really good.  Thanks for sharing.
25775,I have made this twice now....once with spinach and once with broccoli and both times were a hit.  I love how the kids think they are not eating a veggie because of the sauce on it....whoo hoo.  THank you so much for sharing  your recipe with us I will be making it numerous times.
25775,I would give this 10 stars if i could... spinach is a nutrient goldmine... and most recipes limit spinach because a little goes a long way for flavor... Not the case here-- this is mainly spinach and the flavor is WONDERFUL!  Thank you for the GREAT recipe!!! This is surely a keeper!
25775,Very yummy.  It was a little salty though.  Next time I would sub the croutons for something a little more healthy - maybe organic veggie chips or something.  Overall - i would totally make this again.  SUPER easy college dorm cooking.
25775,Very good! Omitted the salt and added some hot sauce. It's gonna become a staple in our household. Thanks!
25775,"Really good after I reduced the salt. With the cream of mushroom and croutons (I used bread crumbs), you don't need much at all .... maybe 1/4 tsp."
25775,Very good.  My picky husband even enjoyed it.  He usually only his spinach with vinegar.  I used fresh spinach that I had frozen.  Will definitely will make again.
25775,"Yes, Karen...it's a winner. Even a picky veggie eater liked it. I used fresh spinach that I wilted, drained well and chopped. Into my permanent veggie cookbook. This was served for New Year's Day--symbolizing green for lots of money in 2010. Thanks!!"
25775,"This is a great change of pace recipe. Since it's richer than most veggies we eat, it'll be an occassional indulgence. I chopped the onions very small and they still had a slight crunch, which we found pleasing. I would suggest sauteing them if you don't like a contrast in texture. Also, a 1 1/2 quart casserole is all you'll need. Great recipe Karen! TY"
25775,"All we tasted was cream of mushroom soup and salt and we used half the salt the recipe called for. My husband couldn't finish it and I ate mine on toast. I didn't bother giving any to the kids. I guess you have to be a creamed spinach fan to enjoy this and we aren't, it would seem."
25775,"I made this thinking my son might like it based on the description, but he didn't, neither did I. It was far too salty. I didn't like the flavor even though I loved the ingredients. My boyfriend thought it was okay, but he would omit the salt and croutons and use breadcrumbs instead."
25775,"I reworked this recipe a lot. I love creamed spinach first of all and this was creamy. I omitted the cream of mushroom because I didn't have any. I used 1/2 cup of greek yogurt instead 1/2 cup of sour cream, 1/2 cup of mozzarella and 1/2 cup cheddar. I used 1/4 cup of onion, couple of fresh basil leaves, 3 cloves garlic, cracked pepper and still used the egg and a dash or two of tony cacheres with some italian seasonings. I topped it with Panko  (Japanese Bread Crumbs) and 1/4 cup fresh grated Parm for the topping. I also used fresh spinach and lightly wilted half of it and food processed the rest of it. My husband and I really liked it but we love flavor so it's packed with it!"
25775,"YUMMY! Followed the recipe exactly except I added a little extra cheese.  I happen to LOVE spinach, but I can see how people that didnt like it might like this recipe. Creamy and delicious! I will be making this recipe again, and again, and again!!!"
25775,"Nice dish for the kids, also subbed mushroom soup with cottage cheese and added dried herbs and garlic cloves to the mixture. Also added chicken sausages in slices."
25775,Kids and hubby loved this I used freash spinach that I cooked then squeezed out the water.
25775,"Wow -- is this ever good!  I made it to take to Easter dinner at my brother's house and it was gone before anything else on the buffet.  Everyone raved about it & wanted the recipe.  I did omit the onion (bro' can't eat them), and the salt (per another reviewer) -- added some chopped garlic and diced water chestnuts for some crunch.  Wish I had made a double batch, 'cuz I didn't get to bring any home  Now that I'm reviewing the recipe, I realize that I inadvertently left out the egg!!  :O   Didn't seem to matter though, as it still turned out delicious, and I am planning to make it again this weekend.  Thanks for posting!  -M =)"
25775,"Wow, this was sooooo good!  I've had this in my cookbook forever and my only regret about this recipe is that I didn't try it earlier.  The only changes I made were: (1) I used fresh spinach from my garden because it needed to be used - so I cooked it, and drained it well,  (2) I use cream of celery soup, because that is all I had on hand.  This spinach casserole is excellent and will definitely be made again.  Thanks Karen for another great recipe!  :)"
25775,"This recipe was excellent the first time we prepared it as written, However;In a hurry?  Substitute 1-1/2 pounds raw spinach (no need to thaw or chop) and mix it in (no need to cook).  I used crumbled Ritz crackers for the topping.  If you have to wash the spinach, shake it well.  Otherwise use it right out of the bag.The same results are achieved in half the time."
25775,This was excellent. I love spinach and any greens so this will work for about all of them thanks
25775,"I will be making this again, for sure! I've been trying to figure out what to do with my Costco sized bag of spinach - I always end up wasting half of it ;-(   I used about 1 1/2lb fresh spinach, 1/2tsp salt (it was a bit too salty, just like the other reviews stated - will use less next time).   I also used Healthy Choice Cream of Mushroom Soup, 5-Cheese shredded blend from Costco - (all I had in fridge) and I used approx 3/4 cup of leftover onions from Crock Pot Caramelized Onions Recipe #24750. I put the croutons on top but when I checked it at about 20 minutes, the croutons were a little too brown so I mixed them in. My hubby LOVED it and requested I make it again. Thanks for posting!!"
25775,I had higher hopes for this recipe. I may try it again with fresh spinach. Thanks for sharing!
25775,What can we say??? Absolutely Delicious !!! My Husband and I loved this recipe !  The only thing I did differently was to saute the onions first only because I use frozen chopped onions.  Thank you !!
25775,This was so-o-o-o GOOD! I love the fact it's so easy to put together with such few ingredients. Hubby even praised the taste. I did add some cayenne pepper and left off the croutons. Yummy!! Made for Zaar Cookbook Tag Game 2010.
25775,Excellent!  I used mustard greens out of the garden instead of spinach and everyone loved it.  I also didn't have cream of mushroom on hand so I made a thick white sauce and put some mushrooms in it.  The casserole turned out delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe.
25775,"This was really good. My roommate, her BF and I all enjoyed it. It wasn't amazing, that's why I didn't give it 5 stars, but it was still really good. I added two big cloves of garlic and some Italian seasoning. I also did 1/2 cup of mozzarella and 1 cup of sharp cheddar. Like I said, good but not amazing. I might make it again, well have to wait and see if it gets asked for."
25775,"the recipe name was perfect for us!  My Dad's a veggie and my husband and mother don't like ""rabbit food"" so it's hard to make everyone happy, but this casserole had everyone saying ""mmmmmm!""  I added portobello mushrooms and artichoke hearts, just made some oven potatoes with rosemary and sea salt to compliment it and served with some slices fresh tomatoes.  It was a great meal!"
25775,My hard to please husband loved it!
25775,"I'm sorry, but my family really didn't like this. My husband didn't even want to try it, which is very unusual. It was too creamy for me, the texture was awful. I was surprised because I really like Spinach dip. All of the reviews were so good, I wanted to like it."
25775,"My family took one bite and didn't touch it :(  Quote:  frozen spinach tastes like cardboard, the croutons on top were dry, and the onions were half raw.  My husband actually said ""Gillian, I'm sorry but you have been chopped""  (from the TV show)."
25775,"My family thought this was just &quot;ok&quot;.  We were surprised to see it promoted as a recipe to get spinach into non-spinach-lovers, because it tasted very spinachy to us.  I made it as written except that I sauteed the onions, and used seasoned breadcrumbs rather than croutons on the top.  Maybe the croutons would have &quot;cut&quot; the spinachy flavor a bit more.  At the same time I made a second casserole using (fresh steamed) broccoli and cream of broccoli soup, and my family enjoyed that one more."
25775,"Only giving four stars because I hate spinach, and although this was awesome, the texture of the spinach was still very annoying."
25775,"I made the recipe exactly by recipe the 1st time and thought it had good flavor. The second time I made it, I sauted the onions before adding to the casserole mixture and thought it was delicious. Great recipe!"
25775,"Great recipe, I made this recently and we loved it, I used french fried onions on top instead of croutons."
25775,"I made this for the first time and I&#039;m surprised that there were not more comments about how salty this turned out.  It called for 1 teas of salt and and I only used 1/2 teas.  Also used Healthy Request soup which has less salt.  Except for the saltiness we liked the dish.  I expect to make again; however, I will not add any salt and use 1/2 the amount of cheese to hopefully reduce the sodium in the dish.  Also, used Panko bread crumbs on top instead of croutons.  I used frozen spinach and cooked it some before making the mixture - next time I will cook a little more as I like &quot;tender&quot; spinach.  Also cooked the onion some, as I have found in recipes that onion does not oven cook tender in 35-40 min.  Overall a good recipe, but needs adjustment for the salt."
25775,Loved this so much! Just scrumptious! Used extra sharp cheddar. Next time I'll make crumbs of croutons with kitchen hammer and spread. Best ever!!
61973,"Healthy, healthy, healthy and pretty good to boot!  I followed the recipe exactly, except for the omission of the vanilla (I'm out), and I actually chose to make this as a loaf rather than muffins, which worked quite well.  Not too heavy, with a surprisingly light crumb.  The carrots and raisins add nice flavor and its just sweet enough.  I could have stood for a bit more spicing or another flavor, but for what this is (a simple, straightforward, healthy, fiber-full bread) its great."
61973,"These are nice and healthy.  I used 1/3 cup sorghum syrup instead of the brown sugar.  DH is a diabetic and the sorghum adds nutrients and has less of an effect on his blood sugar.  The amount of cinnamon was increased to 1 teaspoon and I added 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg.  Because of the moisture from the carrots, I reduced the oil to 2 tablespoons and used canola because that is what is in the pantry.  These sat over night and were served at room temperature.  I will be putting the remainder in the freezer so that I can have bran muffins later.  I like this recipe because it only makes 12 which is the perfect batch for a small family."
61973,The only thing I did differently was to increase the cinnamon to 1 tsp.  This is the perfect healthy muffin to go with your morning coffee.
190,this was okay.  too greasy for my tastes.
190,My only comment would be that it looks is if I should have kept out the 1st patch of  meat cooked and used the remainder to simmer for 2 hours because if I used all the meat I did not have anything to bring to a boil it was to dry.
190,"I agree with gay. Also too many ingredients makes a dish too complictated, I would say a few of the spices could have been left out. It had a nice flavour though!"
190,We enjoyed this so much!!!  Did not find it greasy as we used the lean meat...we did add about 5 cups of tomatoe juice so it was jucier.  Loved the combination of spices!!
30300,"I just tried this recipe and love it. I'm a diabetic and this is a great snack, low in Carbs.  Thanks for sharing it.William"
30300,"Thanks for a great snack. I, too, am diabetic, so this really hit the spot for me. I used five-grain saltines, light mayo, lots of pepper, and a little salt to bring out the juiciness of the tomatoes. Delicious! My son, the junk food junkie, actually wanted to trade snacks with me, but I wouldn't go for it. I think I'm going to try a sprinkle of oregano, and maybe a little light parmesan next time. "
30300,"I love this!  I made a paste out of everything mashed together - I did not add any salt, but I did add a little garlic powder and parmesan.  It was wonderful!  Thanks"
30300,"MiniR,I can see this recipe has not been reviewed in quite awhile.  However, I was going thru one of your cookbooks and discovered it. This has been one of my fave snack foods for year....exactly as you posted it!  And, all this time I thought I had created it...LOL!  Thanks for sharing a refreshing snack with everyone on Zaar.Regards,   DEEP"
32271,"This is great.  Great of course with tall glass of milk.  I made these with my niece and nephew.  They gobbled them up and asked for the recipe for their mom!  We omitted the raisins and used walnuts.  I will try next time with pecans.  Great, no fail recipe."
32271,"Laudee honey, I picked a dessert of yours to make because I assumed it would be just as sweet as you are, and I was so right!!  Simply delicious, very easy to make too.  I made them for the kids for the 4th. and they gobbled them up, thanks darling!!"
32271,"Sorry Laudee, I hate to give this only 3 stars, but I really didn' have any luck with this one :( I found them to be too cakey for my liking. I also found that the middle was still soft and the outside edges were almost burned! I even tried this recipe 2 times and I had the same result both times. Prehaps baking it in two small pans would turn out better?? I also like my brownies to be really chocolatey and these just did not seem to have the chocolate flavour that I was looking forward to. Sorry."
32271,Excellent recipe - easy to follow and prepare. My husband loved the finished product. I would definately make these again.
32271,"Howdy Laudee,  Just writing from Smokestack, Illinois.  It's high time I wrote a raving review on your devilish brownies!  They're fluffy like clouds, floating high in the sky...their chocolatey fudgy flavor is like magic. Although one pot is good, more pots are better.  Love, Mary Jane Pyestake  "
32271,"These are AWESOME brownies!  At least they are the kind that I grew up eating.  There was a Betty Crocker kid&#039;s cookbook that had this SUPER easy and delicious brownie recipe in it that we would always make.  The page was smudged, written on and always opened to that page because we used it so much.  So glad that even though I don&#039;t have the cookbook any longer, I can still find fantastic recipes online!"
71457,"Not rating since it wasn't made with fruit or almond garnish, but I wanted to share my husband's comments. An avid German pancake eater, he felt this  recipe was a bit too close to an omelet (""eggy""), even with the addition of powdered sugar and fresh squeezed lemon juice. Perhaps some tweaking would improve the flavor/texture for him."
71457,"This is just the basic German Pancake recipe I've always made (and seen), just cut in third.  I didn't think it was too eggy at all.  We usually just eat it with syrup, so the fruit was a nice change."
32169,"This was excellent!  I used canned tomatoes because the ones in the stores this time of year are pretty awful.  Therefore I did not add the 1/8 cup water because of the extra liquid in canned tomatoes.  I also left off the hot sauce (my kids won't eat it) and used Italian seasoning in place of the different herbs.  Oh, and I used 1/2 cooked turkey breast (1/2 cup) and 1/2 cooked canadian bacon.  Served over whole wheat spirals it was fabulous.  This is a wonderful way to use up some leftover cooked meats.  Something I'll cook again.  Thanks!"
32169,"Just what I was looking for! I had some left over chicken  that already has a bit of lemon Garlic flavor & decided that it could meld into this recipe- It tango'd, it rhumba'd and it did the Salsa all with perfect timing and in good taste. I used 2 tbsp Denzil's Kamakazi hot sauce. Served over linguine with a small green side salad This is a flavorful easy recipe that  will stay in my favorite pasta recipes - Thanks Sackville Girl glad you didn't have all the ingredients for the other recipe"
32169,This was really wonderful! Full of flavor and veggies and perfect for my Fiance who loves it Hot :) We enjoyed this a great deal served over whole-wheat pasta and it made plenty of food. Thanks!
32169,"Everyone inhaled this! I used a large can of diced tomatoes (they aren't great in Michigan in January!), omitted the mushrooms, and cut the Tabasco in half to make it more kid friendly. Used a whole pound of rotini. Thanks Sackville!"
26835,"Delicious pound cake!  I made this with the intention of using it as a base for other desserts calling for sliced pound cake, but this can stand on its own witha bit of powdered sugar dusted on top. I had no problems preparing this cake.  It makes a large cake and is very versatile - you can vary the flavor slightly by using a different flavor of yogurt.  I used vanilla this time.  It is easy to prepare and turned out great.  It is dense yet tastes light. Thanks! "
26835,This is the 'perfect' Pound Cake! I love the flavor with the vanilla yogurt and am looking forward to try it with another yogurt flavor!  It's a keeper!
26835,"This is really good - dense, firm and flavourful! I used ""forest berries"" yogurt that I needed to use up, and can't wait to serve this to people and play the ""guess that flavour"" game. ;-) Used only 1 1/2 - 1 3/4 cups of sugar as at that point I ran out... Great cake, thanks for the recipe!"
26835,"More like a buttery yellow cake than a pound cake.  Overall it was good, just not as dense as I would have preferred.  Will keep searching for the perfect poundcake!"
26835,"I love this cake! I cut the recipe in half and made the cake in a 5 1/8 cup loaf pan. I used plain yogurt and 3/4 teaspoon each orange oil and orange blossom water, omitting the lemon zest and vanilla. It's fantastic, though for the size pan, next time I think I'll increase the batter by about 1/5. Thank you very much for posting this easy delicious recipe."
26835,"WOW!  I can't believe not everyone liked this.  I thought this was delicious, as did my family.  It was so good, that I volunteered to bring a dessert to a BBQ so that I could make it again.  I sliced strawberries and topped it with whipped cream.  I almost wished I had skipped dinner so that I could eat more of this.  YUMMY!!!"
26835,This is a great easy cake.  It was delicious with strawberries or plain.
26835,"This cake is very tasty and easy to make,but I agree with Lola #3 that it is not as dense as pound cake usually is.Any recommendations?"
26835,"I made this cake for my grandsons first birthday...it was the base for a Finding Nemo Aquarium cake, with all the fish and extras. The cake tastes delicious, was easy to make, hoever, mine was brown like spice cake. Noone can tell me why, but IM making it again, to see how this one turns out"
26835,"I made this cake for my son's first birthday, shaped like a little stuffed horse (his favorite). :)   It was very easy to make, and I put it into 2 loaf pans. I can see why people say it's not as dense as a regular pound cake - it seemed to me like a pound cake/white cake hybrid. I got an almost unnoticeable flour taste in mine, which could mean I used too much flour or needed to use cake flour. I also used orange zest instead of lemon, vanilla yogurt, and a little bit of almond extract along with the vanilla extract. YUM!  Definitely going to make this one again!"
26835,"Fantastically easy recipe and it came out perfect! The cake was so good, it was gone before I had time to take a picture! I am definitely making this again. The only change I made was to exchange 1/4 cup of flour with cornstarch. I had read that a little cornstarch helps produce a more tender cake. I think this addition worked out well, as the cake was more smooth and velvety than other pound cakes I had made with all AP Flour. Cake flour apparently gives the same result but I don't have access to cake flour where I live."
26835,OMG!!! Just took 2 loaves out of the oven. Couldn't wait for them to cool so I had to have a slice!! I used Yoplait strawberry banana yogurt and it is so good. I usually buy store bought cake but as of late I'm into baking from scratch. It makes me feel cozy (winter time) Will be making again for sure.
44045,This recipe was great! Easy and fast.Served with a varity of syurps the family was asking for another batch.As I cook the last.
44045,"We liked these a lot. We live at a higher altitude so I had to add more flour to get the batter to hold toghether. After, I drained my fritters I rolled them in granulated sugar.  Thanks WJKing for your recipe."
44045,"These were great. Had them as a side dish, without syrup. Thanks so much for posting."
44045,"Wonderful!  I used fresh corn scraped off the cob and followed the recipe.  They were crunchy and sweet, just right!  OH!  I forgot, I did add about 1 T sugar...so tasty!"
44045,"These were very easy and quick to make.  The kids liked them better than the grown-ups did, but all in all, they were pretty good.  Prepared them as written except I only used 2 Tbsp oil on the griddle.  A 375 degree griddle was just right.  ~Jeff's Girl Way Out West"
44045,My ex gobbles these things up and says they are good enough to be a snack. I like them too..must admit not as much as he does. I add a little more flour than the recipe calls for though.
83133,"I really liked this recipe.  It was very easy and good!  I used beef riblets which are meaty and easy to eat.  Thanks, Rick B (2)"
83133,I made these ribs using country style pork ribs. It was my first attempt at making ribs and they were great!  I could't believe how tender and flavorful they were.  I will definetly be using this recipe again and again.
83133,"I like quite a bit more flavor. I added hot pepper sauce, 1 tbs., cut the brown sugar to 2 tbs., and used tomato paste instead of ketchup (sugar)."
83133,"I loved the flavor of this recipe.  I browned my ribs (well, not mine, but..) and did the rest as followed.  I used country style pork ribs.  The part I wasn't thrilled with was that they all fell off the bone.  Now, I'm not complaining here, because I figure it was less messy since I could eat it with a fork, no knife required, they were so tender!  I will definately be making these again!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!  LA"
83133,this is a great recipe for when you just dont feel like bbqing... or in my case a rainy day like it was today... I used baby backs and my guests said they were my best ribs yet
83133,These were soooo good. I used Beef Ribs as I was already making a Pork Rib recipe (Maple Glazed Ribs Recipe #140139) and followed the directions exactly. This is a definate keeper and I will be making them again soon. Thank you for posting this recipe to help me satisfy my BBQ cravings.
83133,"I have been the Mr. Mom for 15 yrs. (as well as working) and this is a dish my wife and two children never huff at.  It's fun and easy, great tasting, and aromatic to boot.  I've made this at least 6 times and always a hit.  Great with or over buttered noodles."
83133,"These beef ribs were finger licking good!!! Instead of cooking on top of the stove, after sauteing the onions I poured everything into a caserole dish and baked covered in a 325 degree oven for 2 hours and they were quite tender and tasty. Thanks!!!!"
83133,"Very delicious! My husband is a meat eater and absolutley loved them! I added my own little touch: I added cilantro, onions sliced in rings (not minced as the recipe calls for) and I added about 3 tablespoons of Valentino hot sauce to contradict the sweetness a little. Paula Dean is a genious!"
83133,I made this using beef short ribs and they made the house smell wonderful while cooking.  I will make these again as they make the ribs very tender.  Thank you for sharing this with us.
83133,"Had guests for dinner and everyone finished this up and liked it alot. I did make the mistake of burning (not browning) the onions, so started over with a new pan, added a little oil, beef bouillon , onions to be browned for the second try, and went on from there. Thanks for sharing! Loved it! This goes into the 'favorites catagory'!!"
83133,"This was SOOO good.  I only had one packet of realemon juice (from CiCi's pizza, lol) and no worsteshire sauce.  I used a T soy sauce instead.  Also my ribs were partly frozen when I started and they came out PERFECT.  I cooked these in a cast iron skillet with two layers of foil covering it.  Served with Kohlrabi Slaw and 40 minute buns made into breadsticks instead of buns (both recipes on here).  Perfect Summer meal.  Wonderful recipe, thanks!"
83133,"I made pulled pork with it, tossing all the ingredients in the crock pot and letting it simmer on low for about 4 hrs.  It was a bit dry for pulled pork, so I added some extra sauce.  Very tasty (especially the lemon flavor), but I agree it could have used a bit more zing.  I doubled the worcester sauce and omitted the salt.  Thanks for posting!   (Paul Paul--thanks for the idea of serving it over buttered noodles!)"
83133,These were tasty! I made them 100% in the crockpot and it worked out quite well. Very tender. The sauce kind of disappeared but I served with additional BBQ sauce poured over them. Enjoyed by all. Thanks.
83133,I made this recipe 2 times. Once with regular  store bought BBQ sauce and the other time with all ingredients as listed in therror recipe.  Both were great. The one with store bought BBQ sauce tasted better to me because it&#039;s what I am used to but the original recipe is great too. So give it a try the only thing I did different was keep adding water so that the meat would cook long enough and be very tender.  Great recipe.
104243,What type of bread did you use?  I could only find rolls and breadsticks in my area 
104243,What a great idea! I am making it tonight for a party.
17265,"To use fresh pumpkin: Split the pumpkin in half,  remove seeds and stringy matter with a stiff spoon or scoup.  Roast pumpkin (skin side up on a dark baking sheet) in a 350 degree oven for 50 minutes or until tender,  has little or no moisture and is just starting to caramelize around the edges.  It will slightly fragrant  but not overpowering.After it cools cut it into strips and skin it with a sharp knife then followed the recipe instructions from there."
17265,"What a delicious pie!  I roasted the pumpkin as stated, but just scooped it out with a spoon (easier that way).  The prep was a little involved, but WAY worth it!  The texture of this pie is a little softer than the pumpkin pie I am used to, it's lighter, almost like a torte.  I served it with fresh sweetened whipped cream.  YUM!  The spice amounts are absolutely perfect!  I wouldn't change a thing!  I will be making this for the holidays this year-Thanks for a great recipe, Steve!"
17265,"$25 Pumpkin Pie?  I'll give you $30!  What a perfectly delicious ending to our Thanksgiving dinner!  Thanks for this recipe, Steve!"
17265,"Incredible!!  I have made several different pumpkin pies in this past year, and this one leaves them all in the dust.  This was absolutely delicious!!  Next time I will start with fresh pumpkin and I can't wait to taste the results!  I made this with the perfect Classic Pie Crust #26205 -- what a winning combination!  Thank you so very much Steve for this scrumptious pumpkin pie recipe.  Dianne"
17265,"Steve - This was a terrific pie! Not too sweet, not too spicy and the taste of pumpkin still came through. Whipped cream - Cool Whip - is there a difference?? Thanks for convincing me to make this one!  It is a winner!"
17265,"This was a very good pie, not too sweet, not too spicy. But to be completely honest it didn't taste a whole lot different from our less involved pumpkin pies. Still very good though, a bit softer than the norm."
17265,I am an avid pumpkin pie maker. The October experience always yields me at least a dozen. This recipe was a gorgeous change. With a homemade crust this is a pie worthy of the highest rank and stature. Omit not one step and you'll be pleased.
17265,"Very nice pie.  At first, I was concerned that I hadn't baked it long enough because it was very soft.  But then I read the reviews here and found out that mine was on par with everyone else's.  My only problem was that I burnt the crust with the prebaking plus regular baking time.  And still my crust wasn't crispy.  I think next time I will skip the prebaking step.  Thanks for a great recipe."
17265,This is FAR superior to my normal method for making pumpkin pie. I'll admit to using my own filling recipe ingredients but I made my pies with the technique outlined here. The crust becomes and stays flaky and the filling is lighter and airier than most. A winning combination and the ONLY way I will make pumpkin pies in the future.
     ,
17265,"This is definately my new go-to pumpkin pie recipe.  Good, mellow, full pumpkin flavour, nicely rounded out by the spices.  I liked the fact that this had a creamier mouthfeel than the typical pie- thanks very much!"
17265,Wonderful slightly spicy taste.  Not to sweet.
17265,"This is a recipe I've always hoped to find, and never even knew it.  The filling has a very pleasant, creamy, consistent texture.  I love the flavor.  It makes a nice full pie. Quite photogenic with cracked, slightly puffed up edges.  The prep actually seemed simple, and the bake time is wonderfully short.  I skipped the food processer and used a whisk -- worked fine.  Also replaced that delicious sounding heavy cream/milk mixture with a can of evap.  Great recipe. Thank you. "
17265,"I'm studying abroad in Iceland and I made this for a Thanksgiving dinner the American students hosted. All the Americans was homesick for pumpkin pie, but now EVERYONE says they can't live without it, thanks to this recipe!"
17265,"This is a wonderful pumpkin pie.  Well worth $25!  I loved the ease of preparation, although I did seem to get a dishwasher full of dishes dirty.  I wasn't paying attention and didn't put crust back in oven for 2nd baking before I put in filling.  It wasn't bad, but it could have used those few extra minutes.  The egg wash and short baking time after filling really does prevent the pie from having a soggy bottom crust.  A definite keeper!  Update:  Made two pies this time..didn't line crust and use bean/rice..just cooked crusts until they were completely baked.  Immediately brushed with egg white wash.  Poured in filling and baked with crust shield.  Couldn't have been better.  Even those who didn't think they liked pumpkin pie loved this."
17265,So glad I made 2! It was a little extra work compared to my old faithful but worth it. Most of the first pie is all gone and was awesome for Day After Thanksgiving breakfast. There are only 3 of us and our picky 11 year old won't go near pumpkin pie so now you know where it all went! I had to make a few changes though. I used canned pumpkin and refridgerated pie crust. (sorry!) I have always prebaked my crusts a little even with fruit pies and I would have done it here even if not in the instructions.Thanx for a true keeper!
17265,"This was a really nice tasting pie.  The only difficulties I had was not knowing when to add the brown sugar, since the directions do not specify.  It made the most sense to me to add the brown sugar to the pumpkin, spices and salt in step 5, so I added it there.  I'm glad I had all the ingredients pre-measured (as you suggested) otherwise I would have missed adding the sugar altogether.  The filling didn't seem to set completely, which may have been a result of covering the entire pie with aluminum foil while it was baking (which I opted to use because I don't have a crust shield). Your method of baking the pie shell for fifteen minutes really helps maintain a perfectly flaky bottom crust!  I will definately buy a crust shield and continue using this method in the future."
17265,"Sorry to give this a bad review since I had such high hope for this recipe. But,  the flavor and texture were average. It wasn't worth the effort."
17265,"When I found this recipe was worried about all the steps (this is my first attempt at any pie) But it wasn't that hard once I started and it turned out PERFECT.  The best compliment I got was when my Mom stated it tasted ""Just Like Grandma's Pumpkin Pie"".  I was so proud and will make this my one and only recipe for pumpkin pie.  The texture, taste, and appearance made the perfect pumpkin pie, well worth the $25.  Thanks for posting!"
17265,Best pumpkin pie anfter my own Christmas party last year ended up making this 2-3 times a week for a pregnant friend who's craving could only be tamed by this recipe as i tried others and she wasnt fooled but has turned into a family favorite My husband talks about year round
17265,"I cannot rate this recipe because I used a tried and true filling that my family loves, but I followed the directions for baking the pastry, and assembling the filling, and the results were stellar. I will use this method of painting the crust with egg white, and precooking the filling with any baked pie that has a custard base from now on.  Thank you for the inspiration, and the very clear instructions Steve."
17265,"I made this for Thanksgiving and along with this pumpkin pie, several were brought in and we compared.  Honestly, I am glad I made it and tried the crust technique but for the amount of work and all else, I will buy instead of making.  Five Stars for your well written recipe, a fail-proof pie.  Five Stars for making it happen and having all the ingredients.  I leave it up to zaar folks to decide to homebake or buy."
17265,"This pie was absolutely incredible!  I made it for five Australian people who had never eaten pumpkin pie before and were a little hesitant.  Needless to say, we were all completely won over! They're definitely worth $25."
17265,The crust was nice and crispy. The filling is more custard like than regular pumpkin pie but very tasty. I little more work but worth trying!
17265,"I love this pie!!!  It's a little more work than most pumpkin pies, but well worth it.  I've made it several times and have never been disappointed -- and neither have  any of the guests that were lucky enough to have a piece of it!!!!  Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe."
17265,"This was really good! I decided to test this recipe out to see if I wanted to make it for Thanksgiving, and I am absolutely using it for the upcoming holiday. I used pure canned pumpkin and used almond milk place of regular milk. The baking time was perfect! I like a ""spicy"" pumpkin pie, so I might increase the spices a little to taste, but otherwise this is a fantastic recipe. I will be serving it with home made whipped cream too :]"
17265,"Nothing short of AMAZING! Was afraid to try a new recipe for Thanksgiving. So I made both this, and the standby Libby's recipe. This one blew the old one out of the park! I cant really say what it was that made it better. It was just over the top better. Creamier I think, and just had more of a depth of flavor. I think the brown sugar did it? Whatever it was, it was awesome! Only problem I had was the crust sticking. But that was cause I used a glass pie tin, and didnt grease it first. I also liked that it made more than can fit in a normal 9 inch pie pan. So it was perfect for my deep dish pie pan. Made a nice thick pie.  I will never make any other pumpkin pie!"
17265,"I looked for years for the recipe and crust technique that my grand mom used, especially , fresh from the pumpkin, from scratch!  Thanks so very much, Steve, for reviving a 'lost' recipe for our family to continue to rave over!  Perfect!"
17265,The amount of effort put into the crust portion of the recipe was not really worth it but the filling was very good.  I made it as written except for the omission of cloves as I just don't care for them. The cook time for me was way off as it took mine almost an hour to bake before the filling baked enough that the center was only a little jiggly. I used a deep dish Pampered Chef stone pie plate so that might have affected the bake time.
17265,"The texture was perfect.  Deliciously creamy!  My family thought the pie had a little too much ginger, so we will probably play with the spices a little bit.  Thank you for the recipe!"
17265,"The recipe doesn't explain the time to add the sugar. So I added it to the pumpkin after it was thickened and then added the milk and cream, etc. Steve G, did your your German Granny give you the spice gouge? It tastes just like the best Gingerbread Boys you'll ever eat--should!"
81185,"This is a great idea! It's delicious and it really stretches out the guacamole. I've made it twice so far, the first time i used some chopped canned tomatoes, and the second time I used bottled salsa for the tomatoes. Left out the cilantro both times (though the salsa does contain cilantro...) Easy to make and really good with corn chips!"
81185,"I make a dish like this except I leave out the cilantro and add cumin and crushed red pepper, and sometimes hot pepper sauce (cholula, tapatio or valencia are all good).  Thanks for sharing."
81185,"I just made this with one avocado, halved the salt and  omitted the cilantro. It is wonderful! I will be taking to my women's Bible study tonight with fat free home made oven baked tortilla chips.  It's sure to be a hit!"
81185,"I really liked this.  My dh thought it was good, but said you could really taste the peas.  I used 2 avocados and skipped the cilantro (personal preference).  This might not compare to regular guacamole, but for a low fat dish it was really good."
501028,"We tried this chili tonight, and it was FANTASTIC! Not too spicy, not too mild. Although the addition of chocolate to the recipe sounds odd at first, I must say that it adds that little &quot;something&quot; that you didn&#039;t even know was missing! I would highly recommend this recipe!"
501028,We tried it last weekend and it the entire family loved it!  Spicy but not too spicy.  It is the best chili I&#039;ve ever tried.  Great Crock Pot recipe and the house smelled great while cooking!  Awesome!  In the process of cooking our second batch to take to a Halloween party tonight.
37841,"Fatastic recipe.  I used whole talapia fish..it was wonderful, great taste and very light.  Thanks!"
37841,"This recipe is so easy and SOOO yummy. I've used this recipe 3 times now. Once with a whole fish, salt water white fish I think, my husband caught it on a fishing trip. I've also made it with Cod and Orange Roughy fillets because fillets are just easier for my kids to eat and it came out really yummy as well. My kids are 7 and 3 and they love it as well. I just pick the ginger and green onion off their portions."
37841,"I made this fish for my hubby and my son and they loved it!  I am not a big fish fan but did have a few bites and it was alright, I used tilapia which is a mild fish. I didn't give this recipe 5 stars because I thought the directions on how to steam it was a bit confusing. I just steamed mine in a steamer basket over pot of water and had no problems. I also think that next time I do this recipe I will grate my ginger to get more flavor out of it. Overall family enjoyed it and its healthier than deep frying, thanks for sharing"
37841,"I improvised quite a bit because I did not have many of the listed ingredients.  Ground seasme and peanuts and heated them in the veg oil, used the pollock I had, used a cooking sherry for maranating.  I enjoyed the simplicity of the recipe and from what turned out I can imagine the actual cooked recipe. Skipper/Sy took the time and thoughtfulness to share the recipie with me so I was in a quick hurry to try it as an acknowledgement of the gift received.  I placed the fish on the black rice which had a nutty flavour so it lent some substance to the prepared very light flavoured fish recipie.  I enjoyed it and will scout around for the ingredients listed and make it again.  I could not stand the fish up so I placed a cake rack in the pan and steamed the fish lying down.  In my experience I will make more sauce to pour over.  I follwed the steps quickly so the steam could permiate the scallion and ginger and meld the flavour into the fish.  Chinese food requires the skill of quickness to prevent over cooking which comes with practice.  I have a way to go to master it.  But in all I enjoyed what I improvised with enough to want to make it again.  Delicate flavour."
37841,"I was intrigued both by the cooking method and the use of the hot oil, so I had to try it.  It came out excellently!  I followed the directions exactly except I used a regular steamer basket (with the handle thingy removed) splayed out flat inside the wok with the fish on it.  Worked perfectly.  I used whole tilapia.  My only complaint, if you can even call it a complaint, is the oil was a little too heavy for me, so next time I will probably use a little less.  I'll definitely be making this again.  Thanks!<br/>P.S.  The steaming produces a rich fish broth in the bottom of the wok.  I bottled it and will use in the next recipe that calls for fish broth or fish stock.  Yum!"
37073,These look just like french fries and are very easy to make.  A lot of options with the seasoning too.  2 Tbsp of margarine doesn't sound like enough but it is plenty.  2 yo DS loved these french fries and gobbled them up.  Thanks for the recipe.
37073,Everyone enjoyed these and I loved that they were so easy to clean up after than fried potatoes. I will make my fries like this more often. Thanks Dancer!
37073,"A fabulous low calorie, low fat way of enjoying ‚Äúfried‚Äù chips!  Very easy to make, very clear instructions, very quick and together with ellie_‚Äôs Spinach With Sesame Seed Recipe #138862, they made a totally delicious lunch.  The weather had turned suddenly much cooler today, and I felt like some sort of comfort food, so I made just a quarter portion, which in step 9 I sprinkled with dried oregano and sage.  Thanks Dancer^ for sharing this recipe."
37073,"These were good.  We used oregano and I didn't like that flavor, my husband and boys did though.  I think next time I will add a little salt instead.  Thanks for sharing."
107517,Really great. I made these for my English husband who is suspicious of anything green~~~ he LOVED them!
107517,"I tried this recipe today with 3 bunches of collards with same amount of ingrediants and loved the results! Excellent flavor and I really don't like collard greens. My southern husband said ""less molasses"" but awesome."
50662,"This is a really great casserole.  It does take a little while to make, but it is well worth the effort.  We really enjoyed this and I will be making it again. The only thing I did different was to leave off the step of dropping the dumplings in the bread crumbs.  I just dropped them on top of the cassrole and they baked up and browned beautifully.  "
50662,I tried this the other night and it was alright. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. I don't think I like the texture of the beef coated in flour. My husband said it was alright also...I think I might make it again but not for quite awhile. By the way I used the dumpling recipe( which tasted more like bicuits than dumplings) to make biscuits omitting the spices of course. Pretty good with butter and honey.
108414,"This was excellent! I used a 12 oz. bag of frozen corn with red bell peppers in it, so I used milk instead of corn liquid, as advised. I added a little salt and pepper to the corn while it cooked, and I chopped up 3 jalapenos, which was about 3 tablespoons (or more). This is in a class all its own for cornbread! Very southwestern and gorgeous color. It went with my boyfriend's chili very nicely. Thanks!"
108414,"I have made this a few times and it disappears every time!  It could not be easier to make, but tastes like you spent hours in the kitchen.  I pretty much followed the recipe, but did make one modification.  Some of my family likes red bell pepper, others do not.  To keep peace, I do not add the chopped red bell pepper with the onion, but once the mixture is in the pan, I decorate the top with strips of the red pepper to make a flower-like design.  It kicks up the presentation a notch, and to each his or her own on bread with or without the pepper!  Very, very good!"
108414,I followed this recipe to the letter and it was fantastic!  I'm a big fan of Jiffy cornbread but this really kicked it up a notch.  I brought it to my office party as muffins and everyone devoured them.  Thanks for sharing!
108414,"I have made this a few times now and it gets compliments every time!  Starting with a Jiffy mix makes this bread a breeze in the kitchen.  A wonderful blend of spicy and sweet (my two favorite flavors), also very pleasingly colorful and the smell fills the whole house!  I make this every time I make texas-style chili."
108414,Made this last night to go with Recipe#193641#193641 and a green salad with Recipe#92933#92933 to put on the salad.  What a delicious meal!  Next time I might cut the corn down a little but the smell and taste of this cornbread was wonderful.  I did top it with the honey and it made a slightly  sweet but delicious topping.  Will make this again.  Thank you!
108414,"Easy and delicious. I cut the corn down to one cup, and did not use the honey...it was sweet enough for us without."
108414,"The flavor is PERFECT.  I chose this recipe because it uses simple ingredients that I almost always have on hand, is easy to prepare, and I liked the fact that you saut? the corn, onions, and bell peppers prior to adding them to the mix. Instead of Jiffy, I used Pamela's Gluten Free Cornbread & Muffin Mix.  Unfortunately, it comes in a 12 oz package rather than Jiffy's 8.5 oz package, so the cornbread turned out a tiny bit dry, but I will remember to use a little extra liquid next time.  I made these in a muffin tin (12 muffins) and cooked them for 20 minutes.  This recipe is going in my permanent folder!  Fantastic!!!"
24514,"My, my, what a wonderful mouthful of flavors!!!  Artichokes and garlic are wonderful together.  I did not change the recipe at all.  We are not Sunday nite dinner eaters, just bites or appetizers.  This dish was just perfect.  We loved the flavors, and so easy to make, and was very satisfying.  Thanks Miller for posting this one!"
24514,"this was okay, i think the smaller you can cut the hearts and still handle them the better,   "
24514,"I made this for an ""emergency"" snack tonight and they were superb.  I didn't bother to saute the hearts, just poured the butter with garlic that I'd microwaved over them. "
24514,"Best artichoke appetizer I've tried so far, and I've been trying a lot lately.  Such a refreshing change from the dip recipes!  I also didn't saut√© the chokes after frying - and I didn't have unsalted butter, and I used quartered chokes, might do smaller next time because I just love the flavor.  Very yummy, simple, and unique."
24514,"Great appetizer!  And so easy!  I too just drizzled the garlic butter over them.  I did have some left over, and the next evening I heated them up in the oven and melted a piece of provolone on each --Mmmmmmmmmmm.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!  --Marla  "
24514,"I can't believe I forgot to rate this recipe!! I'm so sorry! I love artichoke hearts and made this recipe with them.  My family fell in love with these, and so did I.  Like other people I did saute my hearts in garlic butter but instead just poured it on top of the hot hearts.  They were fabulous.  Thanks Miller for such an easy yet great recipe!! :D"
24514,"We would like to make this another time before rating it.  We think it has potential, but a couple of things just didn't go right for us.  First, we don't think we rinsed enough of the brine off, because they were very sharp tasting.  Second, they didn't seem to coat well.  It was more like a stuffing than a breading.  The taste of the breading was good, but with the sharpness of the artichoke, we just dind't eat many.  We'll try again though, and hopefully do better!"
24514,"I always fine large jars of artichoke hearts and wonder what I can make with them? So I found your recipe.  I didn't have regular bread crumbs so I substudited cornflake crumbs instead. I dipped artichoke heart into egg first. Then into dry ingrent's: garlic salt, grated asiago or any hard cheese grated is fine,pepper, and/or what ever seasons fancy your buds.   then i sauted/fryed in oil till lightly browned. i then place on a cookie sheet and continued to bake them so they we more crunchy so they could be eaten with fingers. my kids at these up so fast that i didn't have any left to serve to our guest...also a little lemon squeezed over them after would be a good touch. i didn't have any on hand but will do it next time.  thank you   lauri from Cleveland"
24514,"Tasty way of using the jar of artichoke hearts that was threatening to outlive its welcome in my fridge. I used mostly canola oil, and enough butter to go head to head with a bottle of Drain-O and still tasted the artichoke flavor when biting into the juicy center(s)!"
63593,"I am not rating with stars here because I wonder if I have done something wrong. I followed the recipe to a T but these never ""set"" for me. Maybe my envelope of gelatin was the wrong size? DS would only finger paint with it when I tried to give him a bite LOL. Sorry...these sound like such a great idea! Maybe I'll try again sometime."
92533,This worked as a dieters cheesecake although I think if I made it again I would add more splenda.
92533,"Delicious. I am not an experienced cheesecake maker but I was easily able to make this perfectly. I did make a substitution, though - I used part Erythritol (2/3 c) and part Erythritol + Stevia (1/3 c) blend (both granulated) instead of Splenda."
78655,"This was a really good sandwich, I used fresh basil as I have so much growing at the moment! I found that chopping the olive salad ingredients very finely meant I didn't need to process which gave the sandwich a nice texture (less washing up too!) I spread the olive salad / spread on the top and bottom of the bread before layering the other ingredients. Great recipe thank you for posting!"
71635,"Very nice and relatively light cheesecake as well. Mine turned out just slightly too wobbly, using 3 tsp (2,4g for a tsp) gelatin, so next time I will increase gelatin to 4 tsp and only use 1 cup milk. I like this recipe because it can be made with any cookies, ginger snaps, oreos or anything."
38276,"This was a very tasty recipe!  I made it with soy cheese, as opposed to dairy based cheese, and it was ""delish"".  The family devoured them.  I only had two problems with this recipe: the dough was too sticky; I had to add a good bit more flour.  Also, I had more filling than dough; I could have made two more empanadas with the left over filling. The filling was delicious by itself, however, and did not go to waste.  It was also very nice to see such thorough, detailed instructions for a recipe.  My compliments to the contributor!"
38276,"Like another reviewer, I had more filling than dough.  This wasn't a problem though.  The next day I served the extra filling with rice and it was terrific.   It was more flavorful the next day anyhow.  Next time I won't bother with the dough and just make the delicious filling and serve it again over hot rice.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!"
38276,"This empanada dough is fantastic, so good that my husband said he could eat the dough alone with no filling! I used a mix of different flours (all-purpose, whole wheat pastry, bread, and soy), which worked really well. The only thing I'd do differently next time is add a bit of salt as the 2 tsp of soy sauce wasn't quite sufficient. I have to confess that I didn't make the filling this time around because we had leftover enchilada filling to use up. However, I have leftover dough in the freezer, so if I use the filling described here next time, I'll certainly update my review. Thanks for a great dough!"
38276,"I used up the all the filling, but I had to stretch the dough really thin, and it was quite challenging to get the right empanada shape. My family loves these, and they are excellent with fresh guacamole and sour cream.It was a lot of work, but the best part of cooking this dish is the ""later"". We keep them frozen in the fridge and throw them in the oven on nights that I don't feel like cooking- and you know we all have nights like that! Thanks for posting!"
38276,"These were tasty but I had some trouble with the filling being really wet and smooshing out of the pastry as I tried to close them.  Maybe I didn't cook the mixture down long enough.  Anyway, freezing them for a bit before baking helped firm them up.  I used a different dough recipe, but I also had way more filling than dough.  They were a good addition for the vegetarians in our dinner party - they enjoyed them a lot. Thanks!"
38276,"Excellent flavor!  My son and husband raved over these.  I didn't care for the pastry, so I bought some ready to bake pie crust and used half a crust for each.  Also prepped veggies a day ahead and let cool in fridge - filling thickened right up and was easy to use.  I made a double batch and froze the veggies portioned in muffin cups to extend the time I had to assemble them (I could only freeze 2 at a time in my side by side).  I LOVE THESE.  Will cook them again and again and again."
38276,good crust but i just used salt instead of soy sauce (did not want discoloration). i brushed the tops with oil. put them in the toaster oven at 375 for 20 min. also i think 3/4 c of filling is far too much. i put 1/2 cup and could just get them closed. thanks for posting.
38276,"The flavor was excellent!  A bit spicy for the kiddos, but just right for me.  I shredded the carrots and sauteed with the other vegetables to save time.  I also used refrigerated biscuits flattened out for the crust."
38276,"My family enjoyed this different twist on empanadas.  I thought the flavor was a little lacking at first so I added some garlic salt (not much), cilantro and lemon juice, which perked them up.  I also had a ton of leftover filling (about half the recipe) so I froze it to use again.  Hopefully it will thaw normally.  Thank you for posting.  We will keep this in mind for our ""Meatless Monday Meal"" in the future."
38276,"Sounds good, but I am not a vegetarian. I will try these but with a little added left over beef or chicken added."
98930,"Oh yum, this was good.  I added some sliced onion and no-salt seasoning mix.  Served with fresh corn on the cob and homeade coleslaw.  Will make again."
42522,I served this over Memorial weekend and everyone loved it.  The only problem is I should have made a double batch...it went THAT fast.  (I added some sliced black olives on top just because I wantd to use them up.)  This is a great recipe when you need to come up with a quick appetizer that tastes wonderful. Thanks again DebK for sharing ANOTHER great recipe.
  ,
42522,"This was great. I used a combo of fat free and reduced fat ingredients, and a 15.5 oz jar of pinto bean dip, and it was rich and creamy with a great taste. Everyone really enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing!"
42522,This recipe was recommended by Chef #174096. We used low-fat products including a mexican cheese blend for the topping. We also used a can of Hormel chili with beans that we had in the pantry in lieu of the bean dip. We really enjoyed this. Thanks for posting. :)
100870,"Don't we all love dressing up plain old jar sauce? Sommer, you've got a great knack for doing so and this one is no exception. Made as directed using half the amount of stewed tomatoes (that's all we had), 3 cloves of garlic, 1 tsp sugar, and draining the ground beef through a mesh strainer. We also added about a Tbsp of Italian seasoning and a splash of olive oil. Delicious!"
455351,"I made this using emmentaler, a swiss cheese. 1 cup of cheese it not enough for 1lb of pasta. I could barely taste the cheese. Other recipes had 2.5C for .5lbs of pasta. Next time: a lot more cheese."
26995,"I haven't tried your particular recipe yet but remember many years ago a friend gave me a cup of starter that sounds similar to this. According to her, the starter was from a batch that was many years old and had come a long way. I never checked the validity of this but had no reason to doubt her word.  My job with my portion was to ""feed"" it a cup of flour and a cup of milk (or water--can't remember) every week. As I needed it for biscuits or whatever, I took the amount out I needed. The important thing was never to forget to feed it or it would die. Sadly I don't have the starter now as I must have slipped up years ago!  At any rate, it was super and made great biscuits, quick breads, pancakes, etc."
26995,"I had a 'mixture' for over 8 years which made 3 cakes every 10 days - it was a very similar recipe and process.  Apples were the suggested fruit but I have used just about every fruit there is - banana, pineapple and apple being the most successful.  Over the years I exhausted my friends and contacts who wanted to have a 'share' and used to make the cakes and freeze them.The wonderful thing about this mixture was that you could leave it/forget it/ignore it for days  but it would soon come back to life with the addition of milk, flour and sugar.I had to finish with my 'old mixture' when we emigrated to New Zealand but I will be starting another one soon !"
26995,"This is a moist, delicious cake. The hardest part of the recipe is waiting the ten days."
26995,I am so glad to have found this recipe again! It is also awesome with stewed apples instead of the pineapple. I have also made it with grated carrot! Excellent as muffins;in a fluted ring pan or as a loaf. So versatile!
26995,A friend gave me a bag of Amish Friendship Bread that had the starter in it.  The recipe was nearly identical to this (except the starter) but it did not include the fruit.  It was super tasty and easy to make.  After a about 4 repitions I was a little overwhelmed with the amount of bread it made (just me and my 4yr old son). Now with my husband home from Afghanistan I should make it again (and again and again). Thanks! Saeriu
24478,"Quite delicious, even made with the sort of herb they sell in greengrocers."
24478,"I agree with Chef Kate, delicious! The thyme, summer savoury, basil, oregano and bay leaf blend you suggested is wonderful! Thanks Leonard!"
24478,This turned out very nice.  Put the finished product in a pretty wine bottle and corked it.  Would make a nice gift.  Thanks for sharing!
84797,"We had fondue for Christmas Dinner. I made your garlic dill sauce, it was wonderful. I have plenty leftover, but I think it would be great with chips!"
84797,I made the honey mustard sauce with grilled chicken - my husband (who's VERY picky) loved it!  I did double the amount of honey that I used 
84797,"I'm not going to rate this because I only made the garlic dill recipe.  Even though we're diehard garlic lovers, I would have to cut WAY back on the fresh garlic to enjoy this sauce.  Certainly a lot of potential here, but I'll ease up next time to maybe 1/2 teaspoon. Also I used dried dill and should have used fresh. I'm saving this to try the other sauces as well. Thank you, Bergy."
84797,"I tried only the three sauces and they were very good.  Thanks, Bergy, for posting."
84797,I made this for valetines day with a cheese fondue and a chocolate desert fondue. The sauces were very good. I really liked the garlic dill and my husbands favorite was the honey mustard. Very good. Thanks!!
84797,Excellent selection of sauces for fondue & beyond. I made teh garlic dill for our fondue night & the honey mustard just to try it.  I liked the dill w/our salmon & chicken.  I plan halve it in the future as a little extra to go with some grilled or broiled fish.  The honey mustard was just a little 'more' than the bottled stuff - def. worth the small effort involved.  I plan to make it again for chicken strips.
84797,Not the usual sauces I would use for fondue but they were ok for a change.
84797,"I thought the honey mustard was good when I made it but got sweeter as it sat.  The barbecue sauce was really good, I added about twice as much lemon juice and lots of hot sauce.  The garlic dill sauce was in need of lots of salt, especially on meat that was unsalted.  I think next time I'll salt my meat after I cut it into chunks and skip the honey mustard sauce and just use the hot mustard."
75452,"I love this bread!  I did replace orange peel with lemon peel..I forgot to buy an orange.  I also used mini pans, but it seems I had to bake it a looong time.  Even though they turned out very dark they didnt taste like it.  Thank you!  Will be making again soon."
75452,"Ohhhhhh, the flavor of this is superb.  BF picked this out and I must say I was slightly hesitant about the citrus/banana combo, but now I must say, I don't know why!  They balance wonderfully.  The orange is wonderful and subtle and the lemon added just a teensy bit of tang, both of which go wonderfully with the banana.  I, too, did not use cake flour.  I used whole wheat pastry flour, which worked great and omited the salt.  I halved the recipe and baked in a 9x5 pan.  REALLY REALLY moist and just scrumptious.  My one concern, however, is that I felt it was a smidge too buttery, even to the point of being a little greasy.  I might suggest reducing the butter, maybe to 1/3 cup to remedy this?  I'm going to give this the full 5 stars because it is so delicious and I don't think the very-buttery-ness of this really detracts, just I prefer my banana bread a little more bread-like (I guess, drier? Less oily?)  The flavor though... oh!  Phenomenal!  This is the kind of stuff that all you can do is moan with delight when you take your first bite!  Thank you for posting!!"
75452,"a very tasty bread, I would only reduce the sugar next time as I found it too sweet."
75452,I tried this recipe yesterday and it turned out really moist and very tasty. The orange and lemon flavors made the difference... Thank you!
75452,"Not great, just average."
31835,pretty dang good
31835,"This is SO good! Since the recipe did not state how to cook the squash, I diced it and sauteed it and the onion in the melted butter till softened. I seasoned this with a dash of garlic powder, seasoned salt and pepper. I found that half a pan of crumbled jiffy cornbread mix prepared was the 2 cups needed. I mixed all remaining ingredients with a generous dash of poultry seasoning. The flavor and texture of this dish is outstanding. We served it with BBQ ribs and were in hog heaven. What a fantastic way to use summer squash."
31835,"I would give this 10 stars if I could.  Incredibly delicious!!!  I used half yellow squash and half zucchini, both peeled.  I also used cream of celery soup since I like that flavor better.  I added 1/4 t salt and some pepper as well.  Had to cook it quite a bit longer, more like 50 minutes.  Thank you Gabriel!"
31835,This is good!!!  I make mexican corn bread with creamed corn and jalapenos and cheese in it.  Thats what I used.  It was outstanding.
31835,"Great taste and wonderful with chicken! This is very fast to throw together. When I bake a hen, this is what I serve for a vegetable and my bread. I got the recipe from a church cookbook, when travling through a small town in north Georgia. I was going to post my recipe, but this one is almost identical. The only difference is 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. I always use cream of chicken soup and no sage."
31835,"This is close to a very special lady's recipe I know. She shared her recipe w/me (doesn't share many) however, I misplaced and too embarassed to request it again. Now this lady is a super cook. She even baked a coconut cake that sold at an auction to raise $$ for my sick father and it went way over $100 almost $200 so if someone is willing to pay that you must know she can give some people a tough cook off. So glad I found this!!!!! Just hope mine turns out close to hers."
31835,My husband&#039;s aunt gave me this recipe way back in the 70&#039;s - she was an exceptional cook.  I made this at Christmas and my mom  who is now 87 requests it every year.  Who knew it was squash!  Can&#039;t beat and still sharing this recipe.
58651,Super easy way to get your turtle fix.  This recipe is easy to follow and the results are consistent.  Thanks.
58651,Living in Australia *Pixie* I was missing my Turles..mmmm Thank-you for posting this recipe.  My husband and I loved them and didn't take long to clean the pan.
58651,"These are as easy to make as they are good! The crust is yummy and they go together very quickly. I saved a step, and just sprinkled the chocolate chips over the bars as they came out of the oven, letting them melt, and spreading them out before cooling. Thanks, *Pixie, for a great addition to my cookie repertoire. Made for Spring PAC '09."
44061,"I wasn't sure how this was going to turn out, but tried it anyway. It was easy to make and turned out my first try. I put it on my meatloaf and it was the best I ever made!  It would take some getting used plain on french fries and such, but I use it in any recipe that calls for ketsup.  Even my homemade BBQ sauce!  I did seal it in canning jars and it held up nicely.  I can't say how long the shelf-life is because I used it up quickly.  Hint:  Place a couple strips of bacon on top of the sauce when making your meatloaf for something extra special."
24137,well done i just made it the othor day.realy good.
25274,"The fennel and garlic were a bit overpowering, I might try lowering the amount next time...."
67664,My lips are still smacking away. These are FANTASTIC!! Easy to prepare and the flavor was better than pudding pops from the grocery store. I used frozen Barcarde frozen drink mixes like Pina Colada and Strawberry Daqurri. The only change I made was to use nonfat plain yogurt and skim milk for a light tasting dessert. This is great for those weight watchers out there. I now have to purchase more frozen popcycle containers. LOL Thanks so much for such an outstanding recipe.
67664,This turned out AWESOME!
67664,"Dh says 5 stars for sure.  I made this using dry lemon-flavored drink mix, ie Chrystal Light.  He's the lemon fan so they were made just for him.  I made popsicle molds of small paper cups and wooden popsicle sticks I found at the local crafts store.  Just peel off the cups when ready to serve."
67664,"In the words of a 3 and a half year old ""Mmmm, this is yummy, Mommy!"" I agree. I used OJ, and the taste was a bit overpowering for me so I may try a different juice concentrate next time or reduce it from 3/4 to 1/2 cup. I also added a 1/2 cup of frozen raspberries for colour and added flavour, which I added after everything else was mixed and just pulsed a few times so the pieces didn't get too small. Thanks for a great, versatile recipe!"
67664,Such a good healthy alternative.  My preschooler loves these.
67664,"I made these exactly as written, using orange juice concentrate.  The plain fat free yogurt has a really strong bite and these ended up being quite tart.  I'd use vanilla yogurt next time.  I'm sure I'll be making this a lot this summer, though."
67664,This was easy and delicious.  My granddaughter loved making them.  We used bathroom cups because that's what we had.  I used the vanilla yogurt too.  Now her mother is asking for the recipt.
67664,"My three boys absolutely loved these. Doubled the recipe, using a 12 oz. frozen 100% juice pomegranate cherry blend, and since I used plain yogurt, added 1/4 cup sugar. With vanilla yogurt, no extra sweetner would have been necessary, also would depend on the type of juice used. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
67664,I doubled the recipe and froze them in plastic cups. They're awesome. I used Welch's 100% Orange Pineapple juice and vanilla yogurt as suggested by others and half cup sugar. other then I followed the directions just doubled the recipe as not to waste the juice or yogurt. These are awesome my kids love them.
67664,"I used orange juice and doubled the recipe.  I ended up with an Orange Julius like mix, and had a cup leftover to drink.  Tasty!"
67664,"Very, very good.  My son loves these.  He likes tangy/sour things, so using plain yogurt and juice concentrate without added sugar works perfectly for us.  Thank you for posting!"
67664,These are great!  I use 100% (organic) juice and can feel great about giving this wholesome treat to my toddler-who loves it!  Thanks Serendipity Elizabeth....
23850,This soup recipe was a great inspiration to me. I added  8 oz. fresh mushrooms and used a bag of frozen cauliflower instead of fresh.  I also did not puree the soup.  We all loved it.
112140,I added black beans and corn to this and LOVED it! Goes great with Cornbread and milk!
44123,"I just can't say enough about how wonderful this soup is.  Of course, I am a sucker for anything with cream in it and this one does not disappoint.  I will be making this again and again but I will triple the chicken and broccoli because. This is the perfect dish for a casual get together.  I served it with your jalepeno/cheese cornbread (review follows).  Oh, my DH and DS LOVED it, too.  Thanks, GinnyP."
44123,This soup is the Bomb! Don't hesitate to try....Your family and guests will talk about this for a long while. I'm hooked!
44123,This was so good. All my picky eaters turned their noses up at it until I asked them to please try it. Not one complaint came from anybody. I will make this again for sure.  Thanks GinnyP for posting this recipe!
44123,"I lived in San Diego for 19 years and  would go to George's at least twice a year just to sit on the terrace, look at the ocean and enjoy this soup.  Soup, house salad & a glass of white wine.  Perfection!"
137739,"I used an acorn squash and recipe#137681 Sweet Mexican spice blend. Only used 1 tsp honey & 1 tsp butter between both halves,, sprinkled the squash liberally with the spice mix. Baked covered for 45 minutes uncovered or 15.  I basted the squash   with the the butter/honey from the cavity  allowing it to get a golden color.  Lovely Squash recipe Thanks Cookgirl"
137739,This was a nice change. I used butternut squash and the sweet option using a good local honey and unsalted butter. I did not add salt. We ate this on top of recipe#322603 with Balkan yogurt. I may make this again same option. Made for Ramadan Tag 2010.
137739,Excellent recipe! I used butternut squash and the sweet option. The mexican spice mix put this over the top. Thanks for sharing.
8559,it is not that good its watery would not make again she must have forgot some thing in the ingredients
8559,"Sorry, I agree. This is way to soupy to be called chop suey. I drained off the liquid and then had to spice it up a bit with more soy sauce and pepper. I served with rice instead of bread."
8559,I think she forgot to add some cornstarch to make it thick and more soy sauce  :)
8559,this recipe is basicallly great-only thing i did differently was to thicken the broth-i added 1-tlb-cornstarch -to boullion before adding to rest- and found the recipe great ?i served this on rice -thanks dear for your entry=
227924,"OMG this is such a fabulous recipe, and so very easy to make this is just like the ones from Dairy Queen I left mine to freeze longer than 5 hours, this is so delicious, rich and creamy, , I know I will make this many times agin, thank you very much Kit."
227924,This was really good.. but not quite dairy queen. Very easy to make. Thanks for the recipe!
227924,"As a fomer DQ jockey I thought you may want to know that the key to making the inside of these cakes s to cote them in the DQ coating. the choco candy sell stuff is what i mean. You can buy it at the store, but all it is is flavored food grade parrifin wax"
227924,"Loved it, but I changed it just a bit!!! i made fudge brownies and did a small crust with them and a small brownie layer in the middle and it added just something extra special!!!!"
227924,"This was really delicious and so easy to make. My son doesn&#039;t like chocolate so it&#039;s hard to find him pre-made ice cream cakes but who has time for making something from scratch these days? This took 30 minutes tops, not including freezing time - it would take more time to run out to the store and buy something :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We used vanilla oreos - it took about 5 more oreos and 1 extra tbs of butter to get enough crust for a 13 x 9 pan. And we used a bit more than half of an 18 oz. package of cookies, broken up by hand since the food processor chopped them a bit too fine to mix in with the ice cream and cool whip then topped it with Skittles, and it was a huge hit. Even my husband loved it."
118843,These cookies are awesome. It was the best chocolate chip recipe I've ever tried and honestly I won't need to look for another recipe as this was perfect. Thanks for posting a great recipe!!!
118843,"I made these cookies on Monday night with my niece we got 77 cookies quite large they were all gone by Wednesday night!   Amazingly chewy great texture and taste slightly crisp on the outside and chewy in the centre. My niece had to mix by hand the nuts and chocolate chips into the batter. We baked them for about 14 minutes to perfection. When they came out of the oven they were still very soft but firmed up nicely out of the oven on a rack in about 5 minutes.   My niece is makeing them again on Tuesday, her classmates love them!  Thanks, for posting Zuise-Q!"

She asked for the recipe, and the waiter told her that it would cost 250. She said ""no problem, put it on my bill."" When she got her credit card bill, she saw it was not $2.50, but $250!!!! She called the manager, but he explained that they would not take it off, that was the price, and she now owned the recipe. She said to the manager ""That's fine. I will make sure that 'everyone' now has it as well. And so it is. :)"

I was afraid the cheese would either be too bland or too strong a flavor, but it was just right. Everyone loved it. Thanks for another great version of this classic dish. Made for ZWT7."
94710,"These fries were delicious and were a perfect side dish for one of my favorite burgers, <a href=""/186229"">The Godfather Burger</a>.  I made two changes:  First, I baked them instead of frying.  Second, I drizzled just a little olive oil over the fries before baking.  Will make again!  Thanks canarygirl!"
94710,Great fries! I've actually made these twice. I made a small batch for just me and then a large batch for the family. We had these with burgers and they were a great side dish. I added a bit of kosher salt too. Thanks canary girl for a nice keeper that my family enjoyed. Made for Cookbook Tag.
94710,"I did this for Memorial Day May 27, 2013 take some time to recognize and remember our fallen heroes, and the brave men and women who keep our country safe every day. What a great idea - can&#039;t believe I haven&#039;t tried this before! crispy on the outside and so tasty.  I used seasoned salt for the seasoning. My family really liked these fries. And say Thanks for posting this recipe, I made this for 2013 Zaar Cookbook Tag."

90921,"Delicious and very easy to make. I used Broccoli,carrots, bockchoy and snow peas. I do think that next I will just stir fry the veggies. Though they were very good this way. Dh and I both enjoyed this recipe and I will be making it again. Thank you so very much Kari."
90921,This was WONDERFUL! My husband rated it a 5 plus. The honey is so nice and mild in this dish and the flavour is fantastic. Will make this again and again!
90921,"Excellent recipe, Miss Kari. I used mushrooms(uncooked), steamed broccoli, carrots, zucchini, and red bell pepper. The sauce had a yummy flavor with no one ingredient overpowering the other. A lovely colorful veggie meal that my family and I enjoyed. Thanks."
90921,"I made this for my son and he loved it. I also stir fried the veggies (used Brocolli, Green Beans, Pearl Onions, and Red Peppers) along with adding some mushrooms. It came out great and really went well with swordfish."
90921,"This was good, but a little too oily.  Next time I think I'll modify how much oil I'm using.  Also, I used rice noodles because I love the texture.  Actually, pan frying the noodles after tossing them might help and add another layer of flavor.  I'll try again."
90921,"I cut done the oil called for in the recipe, the sauce had wonderful flavor. My family didn't care to much for the vegetables added to it. I might make it again without them."
90921,"very good recipe. i didn't think that there was a thing wrong with it. i didn't think it was too oily.  actually there was one bad thing about it, 1176 calories?! is that a misprint?  i did not add the stirfry veggies."
90921,"I made this recipe with Bourbon Chicken last weekend. It was really good! I added a tablespoon of peanut butter to my sauce, to make more of a peanutty sauce. Next time I may not do that, everyone seemed to like it though! Thanks!! :)"
90921,"I used a bunch of left over Oriental flavor Ramen noodles and the flavor was fantastic! I will definitely be making this again but I think I will make this as a main dish next time adding some chicken marinated in the oil, soy sauce, honey, garlic, onion and sesame seeds before adding it to the noodles and veggies. Thanks!"
90921,"My family and I loved this dish.  Did not use the stir fry veggies (didn't have any).  I served this as a side dish to a sesame crusted seared tuna (we were in sesame heaven, lol).  YUMMY!"
90921,What a great recipe!  Incredibly easy and perfect compliment recipe#54114!  I did cut back on the oil to 1/4 cup and don't feel it made any difference.  Thanks for posting a great recipe!
90921,"Quick and impressive! I used only half lb of ww pasta and cut down the dressing to about 2/3. Sliced in yday's steak, and voila! Solid meal for 4 adults, unless one of them is my DH :)"
